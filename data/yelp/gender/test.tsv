never got a bad meal there .	male
not worth the trip .	male
the food here is pretty good but horrible service .	male
this place has really fallen off .	male
the staff is completely incompetent .	male

nothing to brag about .	male
tried to call and the number does not work .	male
this place is not for me .	male
wow , what a bad experience .	male
my complaint is not about the food .	male
the place was dead .	male
the rooms were not that great .	male
it was a lot of money for average food .	male
that is why they get one star .	male
has n't in over a year .	male
i do n't know why i bother going here .	male
unfortunately i have to shop here regularly .	male
too bad the dining experience ruined the night .	male
you guys need an inventory control system .	male
nobody stopped for half an hour .	male
mccarran does n't seem that bad anymore .	male
talk about low standards .	male
very bad customer service .	male
meat with butter , could n't even test meat .	male
i avoid this place as much as i can .	male
poor experience all around .	male
soggy , and no sauce .	male
this is a little ridiculous .	male
what kind of crap is this ?	male
he could n't care less .	male
this store is missing the mark on many levels .	male
i did n't even care at that point .	male
bland is the best description .	male
the food was mediocre at best .	male
so , i left .	male
thanks , but no thanks .	male
do n't trust this place .	male
this place is the absolute worst .	male
all my experiences have thus far been satisfactory .	male
so i gave it a chance .	male
very disappointing meal there last weekend .	male
no calls , no emails .	male
very unnecessary and not good business practice .	male
concord has lost my business for good .	male
warm rather than hot , and drab .	male
i was neglected from this point forward .	male
until i tried other indian places , that is .	male
second , the layout on two holes is dangerous .	male
just drive down the street to dobson ranch .	male
the texture is all off .	male
the mashed potatoes were even worse .	male
i guess people in arizona like this garbage .	male
the food is bland .	male
sorry folks , but this place is terrible .	male
third , the vegetable selection is limited .	male
nothing seems particularly bad , just underwhelming .	male
a little steep for that neighborhood , i think .	male
this place is quite underwhelming .	male
she was bland and uninterested and slow as hell .	male
rack of ribs too fatty .	male
after this , it only gets worse .	male
drove into an empty parking lot .	male
poor service , noisy , but pretty good food .	male
wife and i stopped recently for lunch .	male
overall , a poor experience .	male
the meat essentially had no flavor at all .	male
i would not eat here again .	male
this ai n't no sesame inn .	male
not even the same caliber as chinatown in .	male
another thing was the rice , simply disgusting .	male
did n't eat it .	male
why does this place still exist ?	male
the pizza is never better than so-so .	male
the service tends to be a bit slow .	male
those days are long gone .	male
but if left a bad taste in my mouth .	male
a restaurant should n't be doing this .	male
what the hell happened ?	male
plus desert is to die for .	male
i do n't recommend .	male
this company is garbage .	male
took too long for as slow as business was .	male
chicken wings were well cooked , hot and crisp .	male
does anyone see a problem ?	male
fries soggy as hell serious ?	male
give me money gone .	male
how wrong i was .	male
this place is a waste of time .	male
service is totally crap .	male
you will not see anyone from the show .	male
not a good place .	male
why is it a problem for me ?	male
this is supposedly the biggest strip club in vegas .	male
full of rotten people .	male
what a let down .	male
the service was pathetic .	male
no wonder the place was empty .	male
the sheets were not even close to being clean .	male
i suggest another cab company .	male
took them almost an hour to wash my car .	male
no stains on the sheets or walls .	male
service was very poor .	male
the cashier was apologetic , but not by nature .	male
garlic knots seemed a little lacking on the flavor .	male
make sure you get everything in writing .	male
flour tortillas are not supposed to taste like that .	male
do n't believe the hype .	male
this place is really bad .	male
slow , rude , unhelpful , and completely clueless .	male
now i need to wait and reschedule again .	male
most of the girls are n't even that hot .	male
rent at your own risk .	male
my server did not want to be there .	male
this place has gone down hill .	male
this was my first visit .	male
the bar itself is n't very appealing .	male
well scratch the quick now .	male
as usual it was mediocre at best .	male
only a moderate selection of food .	male
this is the worst break masters in town .	male
save your money please do n't make my mistake .	male
thanks but no thanks .	male
maybe the food is just always cheap ?	male
are you effing kidding me ?	male
and there was nothing inside the terminal .	male
i hated this place .	male
use this as your last resort to go home .	male
the king triple delight was just so-so .	male
went back after the owner replied to my review .	male
bottom line the place is managed poorly .	male
i would n't call this place authentic korean bbq .	male
food was painfully bland .	male
so when i get my food everything is wrong .	male
they gave me the crunch wrap .	male
it looked like it was under cooked .	male
stick with cold subs .	male
that is not acceptable .	male
this place is straight garbage .	male
my chicken sandwich was dry and uninspired .	male
otherwise , do n't see myself coming back .	male
so i strongly advise against eating here .	male
the drinks here however are very cheap .	male
no where to chain up your bike .	male
so it could n't have been that bad .	male
the wings were stringy and had fishy smell .	male
pecan pancakes are doughy .	male
ill try them again sometime .	male
the neighborhood is questionable .	male
this place sucks compared to newer hotels .	male
too bad it ended there .	male
pho kim long has bad customer service .	male
the service here was terrible .	male
this is the worst fast food franchise in town .	male
first off , maintenance for the complex was terrible .	male
this place is over rated .	male
complete waste of time .	male
freaking nasty , overpriced , and incompetent staff .	male
would not recommend coming here .	male
server kim was awesome .	male
but kitchen has a lot of problems .	male
go to arrogant butcher .	male
tops liquor , this guy is losing you business .	male
i will not stay there again .	male
the five underneath it were thin and dry .	male
my experience here has been consistently bad .	male
a very negative place with negative energy .	male
even the cook gave me an attitude .	male
i will not return to this place .	male
the place was not busy at all .	male
little respect for patrons .	male
the waitress did not appear friendly at all .	male
i will never visit this place again .	male
this place continues to go downhill .	male
at best , this place is a drinking hole .	male
i would n't eat there .	male
prices are too high .	male
i do not recommend .	male
multiple things went wrong .	male
this place is in absolute joke !	male
no big deal they forgot i guess .	male
they did not care though .	male
do not live here .	male
rib tips have no meat .	male
hot links , nasty .	male
i tried my bbq favorite in the beef brisket .	male
what a bad move on my part .	male
the wifi was spotty .	male
there are better options in the area .	male
this is a prime destination of american tourists .	male
the service is atrocious .	male
i ordered a mega bacon cheeseburger and fries .	male
service here was terrible .	male
all in all , a terrible meal .	male
the chicken was dry and bland .	male
that does no good .	male
my gf thought the cobb salad was ok .	male
no wifi offered either .	male
pei wei is just as awful for less .	male
the service was atrocious .	male
the list goes on .	male
old , ugly , worn out , and dirty .	male
just avoid this place .	male
this place is not worth the price .	male
this was bad , even for fast food .	male
the place was nearly empty when we arrived .	male
i wanted so much to like pei wei .	male
this review has nothing to do with the food .	male
really not that great .	male
however , the goods essentially stopped there .	male
all in all , not a great food experience .	male
there are simply better options around the city .	male
not gon na happen .	male
do not eat here .	male
the food is just ok .	male
what a waste of time and money .	male
this place is a very mediocre mexican restaurant .	male
not to mention the food .	male
i thought it was from a sloppy oil change .	male
the steaks were cheap and the kids were obnoxious .	male
i will not shop here again .	male
the caesar salad was watery and not seasoned properly .	male
turns out they do not .	male
very tired and in need of a makeover .	male
the place is a complete scam .	male
bars must be a bad business for making money .	male
the food was underwhelming at best .	male
one of the worst experiences in car buying .	male
came in sat down promptly and order right away .	male
another smoke filled hotel .	male
yeah , just not the room you want .	male
the food does not justify the price .	male
never coming back to this place .	male
the place was a mess .	male
only positive is the beer .	male
tube tvs are way out of date .	male
talk about false advertisement .	male
time warner cable is the worst !	male
this place makes me sick !	male
the sushi here is nothing to be excited about .	male
the service is also poor .	male
the worst experience ever .	male
treatments i received were met with marginal benefit .	male
i was pissed off .	male
first , this is not a resort .	male
the yellow tail was bland .	male
no return trip planned in the future .	male
they did not look good .	male
the salad was what i call a lazy salad .	male
the side of ziti was flavorless .	male
not worth the money spent .	male
bad idea to pick the golden gate hotel .	male
now the bad things .	male
really limited selection : most items seemed really similar .	male
if you are stupid .	male
this family is a disgrace to the art business .	male
but ambiance was not the low spot .	male
cheese on everything but the shit beer .	male
i left and will never go back .	male
maybe i caught them on a bad day .	male
actually , just stay away .	male
save your money , go elsewhere .	male
moreover , the service was lackluster .	male
cheese enchilada tasted like dirt .	male
the place has a stink of a sewer .	male
the food on the other hand was bad .	male
this was a crappy experience .	male
very outdated , and super crowded .	male
do yourself a favor and skip this place .	male
it is nothing special .	male
the pizza was just ok .	male
lights off , doors locked .	male
the waiter was a heavy smoker and smelt bad .	male
taste wise , the pho was horrible .	male
additionally , the brisket smelled like it was spoiled .	male
even my american co-worker thought the food tasted horribly .	male
just like most auto body places .	male
these guys are dishonest people .	male
the hood will not line up .	male
call back and wait an hour with no response .	male
not even an email address from their web page .	male
this is n't a resort .	male
if i could rate them negative stars i would .	male
stay far away from this place .	male
very average food you can get almost anywhere .	male
at this point the issue was closed .	male
not worth your time or money .	male
the worst part ... extra , extra , extra .	male
will not recommend to anyone .	male
the food is below average at best .	male
charges for room is misleading .	male
food was bland , and not really filling .	male
overall not a bad experience .	male
a mess from top to bottom .	male
this is no exaggeration .	male
the breakfast burrito was particularly boring .	male
avoid this place if you can .	male
it could barely pass as a marriott .	male
to the venues credit , it wasnt terrible looking .	male
is there a negative star option ?	male
they dont even have toro in stock that night .	male
it was utterly disgusting .	male
this place was way worse than what i expected .	male
this place is the worst .	male
crust doughy , sauce bland .	male
now i know why the place was dead !	male
the chicken and broccoli is also very good .	male

sadly , it never came .	female
ok that was just the tip of the iceberg .	female
this time , not so much .	female
no offer of to go boxes or anything .	female
the room was not clean ready for new guests .	female
it was completely unnecessary to lie to me .	female
all i could taste was salt .	female
do not buy deals for this place at all .	female
i wish i could give less than one star .	female
but the atmosphere was really lame .	female
no one could believe it .	female
i could n't believe they would serve that .	female
so here i am again , updating my review .	female
this was a non smoking room .	female
it was so disgusting .	female
i am beyond disgusted .	female
poor presidential limo has really dropped the ball .	female
nothing to write home about but not terrible .	female
this is not it .	female
sugar attracts more flies than vinegar .	female
god help , i have no idea why .	female
no tip , nothing .	female
i just was n't thrilled .	female
however , the maintenance for their pieces is terrible .	female
quite disappointed , but at least i know .	female
i do n't care .	female
there is nothing wrong with this place .	female
too smoky tasting with no seasoning .	female
needless to say i will not be going back .	female
wo n't be going back there .	female
do not do it !	female
this particular restaurant is not set up well .	female
super disappointed in this place .	female
overall , not worth it .	female
what a disappointing experience .	female
my salad was disgusting , to be frank .	female
the atmosphere was nice .	female
needless to say , i will not be back .	female
first , let me comment on something else .	female
this place was gross !	female
i was unhappy with the service .	female
i was left with nothing .	female
i was really disappointed .	female
i sent them a email with no respond .	female
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .	female
how rude is that ?	female
nothing more , nothing less .	female
they do n't even deserve a star .	female
i hate all apple stores .	female
nothing fancy , just water .	female
they did not admit her , into the hospital .	female
i would not order it again .	female
like a stale old dirty bar .	female
my food was just ok .	female
the bell hop was rude .	female
dipping oil way too peppery !	female
but i quickly learned my lesson .	female
this is a sorry excuse for a hotel .	female
the food is really not good .	female
the pad thai is not good here .	female
overall , lots of things seem slightly dated .	female
i do not like strangers in my personal space .	female
i left this restaurant feeling really horrible .	female
anyway , on to the food .	female
the service was pretty good .	female
but i would n't recommend staying at this hotel .	female
will not be going back .	female
the bottom was way too loose !	female
bland , and waaaay overpriced .	female
there is no wifi !	female
frustrating start to weekend getaway .	female
i would n't go back .	female
the place was pretty empty .	female
thus , no business for them .	female
nothing special about this place .	female
she made it sound urgent to get this done .	female
i will not be back .	female
so unhappy i cant even tell you .	female
just all around disappointing .	female
the hashbrowns just tasted like potatoes .	female
i wo n't be coming here again .	female
service is hit or miss .	female
you could not pay me to come back here .	female
the food is not good .	female
i was so angry .	female
i was not happy .	female
if i could give it negative stars i would .	female
there is no happy hour .	female
if i could give zero stars i would .	female
i know , i know .	female
i did n't finish it .	female
the workers could n't find my item .	female
total waste of money !	female
sadly , none of that is true now .	female
i am so disappointed with this place .	female
i had the worst experience here .	female
i suppose i expected this place to be amazing .	female
i ca n't imagine the need to return here .	female
that is not the case here .	female
i stopped in for lunch .	female
that is a big no no for me .	female
needless to say we did not stay .	female
they were alright , though .	female
no manager in sight .	female
it is not chicken , i swear to you .	female
i am so disappointed !	female
however the rest makes it so not worth it .	female
service left a lot to be desired .	female
they almost ruined my wedding due to their incompetence !	female
the bread was hard and cold .	female
not fresh at all .	female
there are other italian grocery stores close by .	female
the technicians here are so insanely rude .	female
definitely do not recommend .	female
why you may ask ?	female
old , smelly , & creepy .	female
it was taking forever for our check to come .	female
it was n't even warm in the middle .	female
she also never brought hash browns .	female
my boyfriend ordered the same combo , as is .	female
this hotel is sad .	female
hot as hell too .	female
never ever going back .	female
totally not worth it .	female
not worth the price .	female
staff is unprofessional and rushed with the customers .	female
but i wo n't be going back .	female
it had n't been touched yet .	female
the food was decent .	female
the outdoor area is dirty and outdated .	female
sorry , olive garden , but you lost me .	female
worst front desk staff ever .	female
they do not take reservations .	female
long story short ... .	female
i could n't finish it .	female
i do n't even know where to begin .	female
the bacon was okay , but too overdone .	female
they have no brazilian in this store !	female
the host barely even noticed me .	female
will never dine here again .	female
so , we waited .	female
i could n't even finish my meal .	female
i find it rude .	female
i went downstairs to get water bottles .	female
i would not recommend purchasing extras online .	female
manager is very inexperienced .	female
he did n't go check .	female
i do n't even know where to start .	female
would n't take my dog there .	female
the price was n't half bad for the location .	female
the customer service is atrocious .	female
their hollandaise sauce was sooo salty .	female
maybe i just ordered the wrong dish .	female
she recognized my grandma and remembered her order .	female

we were very disappointed .	female
i would not recommend this hotel to anyone .	female

i just got totally ripped off .	female
never going here again .	female

my boyfriend and i tried the sampler platter .	female
that was definitely not the case though .	female
otherwise , do n't waste your time .	female
it was very busy .	female
made a stop at safeway and requested a transfer .	female
this time could not have been more opposite .	female
i definitely wo n't be going back .	female
what a disappointing lunch !	female
the worst customer service ever .	female
the white bread toast was stale .	female
i was n't really a fan .	female
needless to say i left pretty annoyed .	female
talked to me like i was just an idiot .	female
would not recommend this place to anyone .	female
it was really bad .	female
not my kind of place .	female
ridiculous how unprofessional he was .	female
i was so very disappointed .	female
we wo n't be going back .	female
she was completely rude .	female
she was not attentive at all .	female
worst service i have ever experienced .	female
and yes , the fries were awful .	female
the rice was probably my biggest complaint .	female
the husband had the bbq chicken pizza .	female
too bad everything else was n't .	female
no special dessert ever came .	female
i ate it and i did n't die .	female
cause she saw the mean looks on our faces .	female
food is n't the best .	female

this place was terrible !	female
the rice was bland .	female
the service was absolutely horrible .	female
i could have replaced multiple pieces for far less .	female

this is an absurd price for bowling .	female
nothing special about it .	female
nothing to come back for any more .	female
and , sadly , we were n't impressed .	female
i would n't eat here again .	female
avoid at all costs !	female
totally depressing if looking for anything organic .	female

no response from the nurses .	female
i was really disappointed in this property .	female
there were no drink prices listed anywhere .	female
