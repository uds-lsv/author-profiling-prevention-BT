i did not care for the bbq sauce .	male
the chips for the salsa were stale .	male
unfortunately , pita house falls short .	male
falafel was not very good .	male
from the start the manager was very condescending .	male
the pizza is horrible .	male
very poor customer service .	male
this was my first visit here .	male
never stay here if you can avoid it .	male
i highly recommend getting a bargain hotel elsewhere .	male
it is not worth the savings .	male
bad service and bad food .	male
i will not be returning here .	male
worst mexican food ever .	male
after she was treated properly , she healed quickly .	male
my bad for going there .	male
even the tortilla chips were bland .	male
the food ai n't bad .	male
this wo n't take long .	male
bad service and bad product .	male
the drinks are standard giving this place nothing special .	male
stay away , there are many better options downtown .	male
are you people insane ?	male
i would never ever recommend these guys .	male
first , no salt bagels .	male
are n't salt bagels one of the standards ?	male
the other half was basically dry .	male
the pizza tasted like junk .	male
well , my wife and i just left disappointed .	male
the sauce on it was horrible she said .	male
from that point , everything went down hill .	male
the food was good , but nothing special .	male
expensive for food that taste like nothing .	male
will not eat there again .	male
not worth the wait when hunger .	male
i highly doubt it .	male
this is the slowest pizza hut to ever exist .	male
stayed here this past week on business travel .	male
how do you mess that up ?	male
please do n't make the same mistake i did .	male
this place is a complete scam .	male
this place is my worst nightmare come true .	male
the parking lot is worse .	male
i wo n't give it just one star though .	male
out with the new , in with the old .	male
nothing special about the burgers .	male
i had hue style beef stew pho .	male
paid top dollar for shampoo full interior and wax .	male
not worth the money .	male
this place just sucks .	male
it tends to be the most expensive gas around .	male
also , avoid the coffee .	male
it tasted pretty bad .	male
i have to say this was no treat .	male
overpriced , food is pathetic compared to persian kabobs .	male
food is bland , bland , bland .	male
the place was somewhat busy but , not really .	male
but for dinner ... way overpriced , way overrated .	male
but warning ... do n't do takeout there .	male
that pretty much ruined my experience .	male
absolute crap of service .	male
but then again this is las vegas .	male
the service was where our family was greatly disappointed .	male
this place is unbelievable !	male
please do not give this place your business .	male
the food was not very good .	male
cocktails were not up to par either .	male
food is overpriced ... not a good value .	male
but this one is always short staffed .	male
now the bad news ... the service .	male
i have eaten here many times .	male
and quite simply put , not worth it .	male
very tough and dry .	male
only thing is they are kinda expensive .	male
cornbread average , catfish ok .	male
the overall experience has kept me from going back .	male
my wife had the same experience .	male
they do n't take care of your car .	male
the soup was tasteless .	male
the bison rib-eye was all gristle .	male
another example of bad italian food in pittsburgh .	male
the food is sub-par for a traditional restaurant .	male
the cannelloni was good , but nothing special .	male
and nobody smiled at anyone else .	male
just all around disappointing .	male
what i found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating .	male
my wife ordered chicken and prosciutto with pasta .	male
no wonder this place was empty .	male
that is not the case here .	male
soda machine was broken .	male
will not be returning .	male
this place was really bad .	male
you no longer deserve my business .	male
no wonder this place gets bad reviews .	male
will not return back to this place ever .	male
nothing was served until i asked their server again .	male
have eaten here a few times .	male
not a good way to win over customers .	male
it has potential , but obviously lacks good management .	male
i would not come here again for the food .	male
she asks employee to scale back .	male
sadly its one of the better bars in middleton .	male
does it get any better ?	male
maybe i did not get the right thing .	male
service was courteous and prompt .	male
has to be china , or possibly hell .	male
this location fails at that .	male
shame that they are the only show in town .	male
all the fixes were minor and the bill ?	male
avoid it if at all possible .	male
badger cab is a mixed bag .	male
food is not that good .	male
this review is long overdue .	male
would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .	male
a bad but learning experience nonetheless .	male
so everyone else had to watch me eat .	male
this was not the case here .	male
greasy tasteless stale food .	male
low grade features are not luxury .	male
nothing gets done when dogs bark at all hours .	male
everyone has bad days .	male
ok , ok i thought to myself .	male
just kidding , out again .	male
nope , as long as last time .	male
and the food was even worse .	male
avoid this terrible hertz .	male
two thumbs way down .	male
food was ok , nothing special .	male
no more , no less .	male
the fries were unremarkable .	male
boy was that a mistake .	male
absolutely terrible service from our waitress .	male
so late night dining options are somewhat limited .	male
only one tv of the two worked .	male
it just was n't very good .	male
none of the staff seemed up and happy .	male
but not in a good way .	male
the first nurse she encountered was somewhat friendly .	male
procedure did not take ten minutes .	male
talk about bad service .	male
stopped by last night shortly after opening .	male
well i was wrong .	male
on the positive , restaurant seems cleaner .	male
beyond that , restaurant remains subpar .	male
my order upfront was wrong on three separate occasions .	male
your parking space is no where near the unit .	male
biased towards the left - the far left .	male
carne asada was more like hamburger crumbs .	male
generally this was just average at best .	male
i would recommend you look elsewhere for better service .	male
i gave him my number .	male
the sauce for the steamed dumplings was way off .	male
the hype is not real .	male
avoid this company if you can .	male
i said no thanks .	male
my expectations are low .	male
the wife would never go back again .	male
scratch this one off my list .	male
the brisket was almost pure fat .	male
not in this case .	male
i put my card in it and wait .	male
this needs no explanation .	male
if you want a beer your forget it .	male
why am i the first to review this place ?	male
very rude , not deserving of our business .	male
places like this do not deserve our business .	male
gut bomb was more like it .	male
i surely wo n't be back .	male
not formal enough , nor timely .	male
just too many amazing dining opportunities in phoenix .	male
the food is really bad and the selection limited .	male
the staff however is some of the worst ever .	male
my wife drives by this place all the time .	male
absolutely the worst bbq i ever had .	male
the ribs were dry and rough .	male
and , the food is not up to par .	male
you will not find it here .	male
no repeat visit for me .	male
the food just is n't that great .	male
the biggest problem though are the drinks .	male
the sushi itself was extremely underwhelming .	male
delivery guy showed no care for the pizza .	male
average drink prices these days , nothing special .	male
filing in small claims court this week .	male
uh , uh , you mean the store manager ?	male
this place was awful .	male
jerry : i do n't think you do .	male
i would skip this restaurant .	male
beware of any payment problems at this place .	male
i walked in and asked about their lunch specials .	male
as a result i will not go back .	male
this place serves a poor excuse for japanese food .	male
the arcade is awful .	male
no offer to comp anything .	male
no , definitely condition x , he says .	male
find a better establishment for testing .	male
poor food poor excuses and apparently poor ownership .	male
the layout of this location is insane .	male
ok , so it was n't that bad .	male
highlight of the meal was the apple pie .	male
it was ok , but nothing special .	male
they just ca n't get it right .	male
the service is very below par .	male
it was quite dry and not all that tasty .	male
it was like some sort of sleep torture .	male
the new interior has lost all its old charm .	male
there are better options .	male
old , dingy , better places to stay .	male
i highly suggest not eating here .	male
a complete insult to italian cuisine .	male
the ciabatta bread was cold .	male
so i get the bartender and explain the story .	male
uncomfortable to say the least .	male
food , service , everything else is so average .	male
this place does n't deserve the business .	male
this place is downright awful .	male
avoid them at all costs .	male
the food quality is very cheap .	male
the fish was bad and smelled .	male
here comes the biggest problem ... .	male
the desert had no prices .	male
trust me , this place is a bust .	male
you should avoid this place at all costs .	male
nothing could be further from the truth .	male
so i guess your asking why only two stars ?	male
bad choice coming here for lunch .	male
owner is extremely rude .	male
nothing impressive at all .	male
dont waste your time .	male
avoid this place at all cost .	male
the grilled artichoke was on point , though .	male
i really tried to like this place .	male
i ordered from here recently .	male
could of possibly been bad .	male
do not go here if you enjoy being respected .	male
worst climbing gym i have ever been to .	male
terrible establishment with terrible values as a business .	male
anyone who gives them business should be ashamed .	male
slow service and mediocre pizza .	male
replacement hotel was not good either .	male
do not trust this property .	male
if you want a dessert latte go to mcdonalds .	male
oh , how the mighty have fallen .	male
its not that great .	male
worst insurance experience ever .	male
this is not based on a single experience .	male
first , our waitress was not well informed of the offerings that evening .	male
third , the food was lacking in proper seasoning and without any taste .	male
gross obviously from a plastic container no way smoked in house .	male
is that how a store is supposed to be run ?	male
i will say this , it is not the church brew that i remember .	male
they turn off the pepsi machine so you ca n't get a refill .	male
i was really hoping that this place would have good food .	male
got keys to our room and bell person took our bags .	male
as soon as we presented our coupon the attitude by the restaurant staff changed .	male
this should not have been presented as dinner , but rather a snack break .	male
just awful , personnel were helpful , but the service was terrible .	male
restaurant was almost empty you would think the service would be better .	male
if you sit at a table , you will be ignored .	male
good flavor , but the dumplings were runny and ruined the entire experience .	male
my date had the veal marsala which was a stretch to call pedestrian .	male
the side of mashed potatoes was fine , but too much for one person .	male
heck , any kind of service would have been nice .	male
this highest rated restaurant in the valley was an embarrassment .	male
chalk it off to a bad experience but hope they fired the waiter .	male
next time i can just use up this card real quick i guess .	male
not a good situation we were told it would take a half hour .	male
no one should have to wait that long after being seated .	male
it looks like your sitting on the inside of a elementary school gym .	male
i do n't want to go on a plane that is going to crash .	male
this is a major rip-off , and a horrible product .	male
we had a lamp that was removed as a safety hazard and never replaced .	male
the first time i ordered a sauce mixture , it was n't an issue .	male
this led me to wonder if they washed their bowls between customers or not .	male
very sad that there are people out there taking advantage of per owners .	male
but in sum total , the experience was a let down .	male
i can see why the other ratings say extremely rude staff .	male
much better prices & return policy at any pawn shop anyway .	male
i seriously doubt the beef was brisket , as it was dry and lean .	male
what happened to them , on saturday they looked like they were doing business .	male
barbecue is only as good as the cuts of meat start with .	male
their cuts seem to be on the cheap and tough side .	male
hush puppies were the only thing that lived up to advertising .	male
now the prices are outrageous and the food quality is very poor .	male
they said they were sorry but you could tell they couldnt care less .	male
ok , i am of two minds on this place .	male
the gm did not respond to any of my emails .	male
it was just too high priced for what was given .	male
slow service , bad online ordering site , greasy pizza .	male
expect to stand in a long slow line for your serving .	male
i ca n't see how this place has as many stars as it does .	male
if you stick with that , you ca n't go wrong for the price .	male
it really kills my vibe when i come in here .	male
no one smiles , when i ask questions i get short , uninterested responses .	male
another bad impression given to any new person arriving in this town .	male
the rellenos was covered in some generic tomato sauce and was bland tasting .	male
chipotle or even taco bell would be a preferred dining choice .	male
not once did i ever see them check the chemical levels in the pool .	male
but like i said , i never once saw them check the chemical levels .	male
sales i had no problem , but be careful after getting your car .	male
only problem is they lie about how long it will take .	male
sorry pete if you still around , it really suck !	male
the atmosphere is not bad , pretty much expected for a wine bar .	male
unfortunately , my experience with the store on rancho and decatur has changed that .	male
no offer to contact the insurance company or have someone else look at it .	male
the best way to sum this up is frozen overly processed fish .	male
the food is not nearly as good as it used to be .	male
that is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such .	male
the place is dirty and not as lively as it was .	male
what kind of training does starbucks provide to their staff ?	male
the sauce was not good and the meats had no smoke flavor .	male
it was dry it fell apart and had a stale and bland flavor .	male
i was really disappointed by how tough the meat was .	male
it was almost too much work to get the meat off the bone .	male
what happened to the scottsdale location , does anyone know ?	male
went recently on a saturday , bad food and bad service .	male
handed me the work order and tells me to fill this out .	male
food was ok , but the reason for the low rating was the service .	male
portions are plentiful , the atmosphere is comfortable , and the food is average .	male
the construction was delayed and seemed to drag on forever .	male
dogs just ok , nothing special and same with the burgers .	male
would have been higher rating but the service was terrible .	male
i just had one of the worst grocery shopping experiences of my life here .	male
i drove up the street to albertsons right after and purchased the same groceries .	male
it is the worst mac and cheese i have ever had in my life .	male
come here if you want to get ripped off and unsatisfied .	male
when you are that young , you simply do n't know any better .	male
i rarely write a review , but i feel in this case i must .	male
this place is located in the middle of a bad residential area .	male
the place had a horrible smell and was run down .	male
my first review of this place was from my buying experience .	male
everything we have eaten from this place has been very tough and chewy .	male
not a single word , apology or update on the speed of the food .	male
nonetheless , this place is nothing more than average by far .	male
that is the biggest bull crap i have ever heard .	male
i never had a great meal , but i never had a bad one .	male
and my fist taco was just bland and not good .	male
the orange chicken and honey chicken are the same thing and very very bland .	male
french fries were barely cooked dripping with oil and soggy .	male
however , the movie selection at this place is lousy .	male
you should just go to fedex where they gladly accept your patronage .	male
so all we had during those hours waiting was weak bland coffee .	male
the steaks are ok , but thin for the price and always overcooked .	male
will not come back , unless i do n't find a better italian food .	male
the management there was less than interested in fixing any problems we had .	male
save you time money and appetite and find a different place to eat .	male
i would not go back here , chinese fast-food should not be this bad .	male
good cheap beer and slot machines but stay away from the hot dogs .	male
the second bite i bit something hard like a rock and it was over .	male
no wonder this place is empty every time i have ever driven by .	male
the rice was cooked perfectly but had nothing special to it .	male
no seasoning and the fries were cheap frozen fries with no salt or seasoning .	male
i ordered the beef hash stuffed omelette and my wife ordered salami and eggs .	male
this is one that will be better coming out than going in .	male
better than dairy queen but still not real good food .	male
i live real close to this location and i avoid it at all cost .	male
we first went to chase which took all of ten minutes .	male
i ordered the pan pizza little to no sauce on it .	male
the older man that owns the place really talks down to people .	male
with this management they will not be around for long .	male
sorry to be so negative , it has earned it however .	male
the basil crispy chicken just did n't work for me .	male
showed up to the ghetto as expected , but the meal was underwhelming .	male
it was so horrid my gf and i broke the lease .	male
leasing office did not want anything to do with it and wouldnt get involved .	male
the maintenance crew there leaves much than do be desired .	male
just order from one of the two sites i listed above .	male
the end result was that i left my loaded cart and walked out .	male
the bagel was mediocre , a little bit old but whatever .	male
the waiter offered us comp deserts for the trouble , at least .	male
the server checked back late upon original service and too late for drink refills .	male
the staff are ... well , you could n't hire worse individuals .	male
the tsa staffing in security is absolutely the worst i have dealt with .	male
they had a bucket under the sink to catch a leak .	male
the only decent person here is the greg a - the salesmen .	male
shrimp was room temperature , all steaks were rare , ordered medium rare .	male
she never adds salt to her meals but needed to on this .	male
i would n't go out of my way to eat here again .	male
as others have said , decor and location are horrible .	male
the salad was n't really fresh but the ginger dressing was passable .	male
the server argued that it could n't be cold and walked away .	male
the dining area is too dark and the lunch buffet is mediocre .	male
the only thing made in house the night we visited was the meatloaf .	male
i do n't need beans and rice on the same plate .	male
i just do not want anyone else to have to deal with these crooks .	male
dropped in to quality bumper a dealership recommendation for some running boards .	male
i am a fan of the show but would not recommend visiting the store .	male
none of the stars were there and it looks different than on the show .	male
even the photos on their drive thru menu look bland .	male
who know buying a car would be one of the most stressful experiences ever ?	male
then i will get a drink that taste like someone pissed in it .	male
i do n't mind paying higher prices if it comes with better service .	male
the focus was on presentation , not on providing a real meal .	male
once in baggage , i did not see a driver with our name .	male
our bags came several minutes later , still no driver .	male
i would suggest to avoid this place for long term emergency care .	male
i ended up only staying for a week at this extended type of hotel .	male
i had a hot dog , fries , and a vanilla malt .	male
i would give this rat hole zero stars if possible .	male
what really struck me was the current condition of the cleanliness of the restaurant .	male
the lo mien tasted way too greasy and was flavorless .	male
the chili was not very good either and the fries were pretty tasteless .	male
au jus had never made a steak more well done in my experience .	male
i felt ripped off and will never stay at the rio again !	male
even when they have the staff to take care of it .	male
the bottom of the pizza towards the center was totally uncooked and soggy .	male
this was perhaps one of my worst restaurant experiences ever .	male
the waitress who took the order never apologized or acknowledged the issue .	male
problem is service , wine list , and beer list .	male
i asked management and they stated ownership is trying to do things different .	male
unfortunately this will probably be the last chance i give this place .	male
the portions have gone incredibly down yet the prices have gone up .	male
the restroom , mostly the shower , smells like a combination urine and mold .	male
this is not mac and cheese pizza so much as mac and dough pizza .	male
the cheese stick was good and hot and how a cheese stick should taste .	male
not acceptable if you have the same standards i have .	male
you get what you pay for , and this place is still a ripoff .	male
so , obviously will not be staying there on future visits to charlotte .	male
these people are not helpful , nor do they care .	male
empty tables , except for the staff eating in the dining room .	male
in short , i was told no , no , and no .	male
reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough .	male
the two sides i ordered were the fried okra and the mac and cheese .	male
terrible service for overpriced moderate quality sushi in a roach infested strip mall .	male
whatever you do , please avoid renting from this hertz location !	male
my wife drove off without letting these thieves touch her car .	male
i was n't exactly happy with this response and demanded that something be done .	male
after the second starter was supposedly installed the sound still never went away .	male
at this point im better off writing it as a loss and moving on .	male
one was completely wrong so they had to redo it .	male
they are the worst bunch of salespeople in the city of las vegas .	male
tvs everywhere but they have the same game on repeat sets .	male
i just called the manager and he pretty much did n't care .	male
had my honda in to fix a power steering pump .	male
my bad as i should have checked the receipt before i left .	male
we were then not followed up with by her , or even acknowledged again .	male
the food was ok not much flavor on the chicken .	male
six dollars for a price of pizza , four for a bag of candy .	male
the atm machine looks like it would steal your pin number .	male
avoid this place , unless u seriously cant afford another spot .	male
really poor compared to the place around the corner but the same price .	male
which is a puppy mill and the papers of are worthless .	male
the sound was so bad that i feel they ripped me off .	male
ps : and wtf is up with not taking credit cards ?	male
had a rather disappointing meal and service experience here last night .	male
the property is in tear down condition and no one is in the casino .	male
there was n't much of an option because it was late at night .	male
beware not the classy joint its advertised to be in my experience !	male
i really hate to leave a bad review for this place .	male
so i really really really wanted a philly cheese steak tonight .	male
not a huge helping , one of those small condiment to go containers .	male
the beans were very greasy but hey this is n't health food right ?	male
it takes management several weeks to a month to finish or begin repair requests .	male
people leave garbage around the complex , and the laundry room is terrible .	male
it was like they just cooked the beef with no flavoring at all .	male
i think i will give this place one more try before i pass completely .	male
i agree with the last reviewer , this baja is going downhill .	male
i do n't know what went wrong with this place .	male
the pesto pizza was good but nothing to write home about .	male
the seating is extremely close from one another and the rows are crowded .	male
quite possibly the worst chinese food experience of my life .	male
do not eat here should be the only sign on their door .	male
this is a dangerous and unhelpful bar and grill in my experience .	male
she really set the tone for the evening and unfortunately it was n't good .	male
they give you plenty but plenty of tasteless food is not bbq !	male
the situation at the door just was n't handled very well .	male
it was basically a slab of meat with some au jus sauce .	male
recommendations : hit up the local black angus or outback steakhouse instead .	male
this place is like many of your chinese buffet in every town .	male
however , this place is more expensive and japanese version .	male
we scheduled the appointment a few days prior to me being in town .	male
i wish i could give them less than one star .	male
learn from my errors , find somewhere else for your small engine repair work .	male
i had the fillet trio , with three different sauces and was satisfied .	male
very difficult to find a good deal on the wines .	male
the lack of consistent fees and policies has hurt my experience .	male
nobody can talk as loud and as much as this guy .	male
the chicken parm and gnocchi was pretty delicious , i must say .	male
my buddies marsala and my parm each included a side of spaghetti .	male
my friends wife changed her spaghetti , to one with a meat sauce .	male
first of all , the pie had almost no real flavor .	male
the dough , sauce , cheese ... even the pepperoni was bland .	male
so my wife and i went in to purchase window treatments for our house .	male
comparing with another sam woo , this one is expensive one .	male
if you are selling a car please check around to get a better deal .	male
las vegas valley really needs some competition in the cable internet service .	male
walked over from the nearby hotel to grab something quick .	male
unbelievably poor service and super expensive on top of that .	male
do not go for lunch ; this is not that kind of pizza place .	male
this place is hit or miss , and seems to be a miss recently .	male
native new yorker is not the same as it use to be .	male
no sign was seen and our waitress also did not alert us .	male
lame ... bring back the old native new yorker and management .	male
the lo mein was the same way and my wife could n't eat it .	male
later that night my wife was in pain from the food .	male
do n't count on using their wi-fi though ... it sucks .	male
you get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy .	male
so they said they would run it through again and vacuum the seats .	male
not far from here are better options for both at a much better value .	male
most did n't have any additional sauces with them to compliment the flavor .	male
i was hoping for a truly legendary cheese steak experience .	male
unfortunately i was more than a bit disappointed with flavor .	male
the salmon was undercooked , so i asked the server to cook it more .	male
not worth your time , unless your a fan of the show .	male
do i want a plate of sausage gravy or some turkey sausage ?	male
then i ordered a burrito , which came with rice and beans .	male
the burrito was ok , as were the rice and beans .	male
that lasted less then one day due to the smell .	male
worst equipment provided on my third remote in less than a year .	male
taking two hours past the appointment time is just way too long .	male
this place has always been bad and it will never get better .	male
by the time the sides came out the food was cold .	male
everyone for the most part thought this was a horrific evening .	male
on average , i eat at ten restaurants a week .	male
whatever you do , avoid hertz at all cost at this airport .	male
this is the worst place i have ever eaten at .	male
i canceled my membership and they lost a customer for life .	male
avoid this place unless you enjoy waiting and waiting and waiting .	male
also you need to wash your hands before serving food after counting money .	male
is it me or have the prices at garden ridge gotten ridiculously high ?	male
oh , and by the way ... your prices are n't that great .	male
i sent the letter and it appeared the matter was over .	male
it was a mess trying to deal with the owner .	male
everything was fine until something in your apartment breaks and needs to be fixed .	male
well , my wife had a hair in her shake sooo that is disgusting .	male
i immediately called the restaurant and a guy at the bar responded .	male
so the last three meals from this place has been worse than the last .	male
although the food presentation was nice , the dishes had no flavor .	male
these should be full of flavor and it was bland .	male
for the prices they are charging the food should wow and it did not .	male
i do n't know how they manage to stay in business .	male
the pride of that door quickly melts away as i order the food .	male
the sad excuse of a burger arrives and i decide to google the food .	male
it was a bucket of dry pasta with some cheese and meat .	male
either the fried rice is decent , and the meat is not .	male
very lean actually , which is a sign of lower grade prime rib .	male
literally they kept their heads down and refused to make eye contact .	male
this jack in the box has made me sick on a few occasions .	male
getting charged for ranch when it comes with your meal is ridiculous .	male
is n't this a casino hotel where guests sleep in ?	male
but the desserts , which look great , are awful .	male
but a word of warning , dont use the valet service .	male
stayed here in april for a university of wisconsin sporting football game .	male
with luggage for three it was difficult to navigate from within .	male
sleep number beds are like sleeping in an air mattress .	male
come to think of it , maybe that is why he is angry .	male
places like this seem to have a really difficult staffing problem .	male
i just did n't have the same experience that other people did .	male

and i doubt i would ever recommend the diamond to anyone .	male
in this case nope , nothing , just thanks anyways .	male
my wife and i went with another couple for a birthday celebration .	male
i would n't reccomend it for more than maybe the beer and garlic fries .	male
it this does n't deter you from here i do n't know what will .	male
why do n't you put that in your back pocket ?	male
the tiramisu was a bit dry , but was still tasty .	male
quite possibly the worst experience i have ever had dealing with a clothing store .	male
it was good but did not blow me away , kinda disappointing .	male
ordered the spring rolls and the bbq pork meat balls for apps .	male
their on-line inventory look up has been wrong every time i have used it .	male
all three flights experienced significant delays , two for mechanical reasons .	male
a worst in the airline industry phone app , however , makes things worse .	male
when we arrived , they were unable to locate the car in question .	male
i mean , has he seen my other review of blueberry hill on flamingo ?	male
on the upside , the service was a little faster .	male

service was what you would expect from a burrito joint , nothing stellar .	male
fairly mediocre , even by the relatively modest standards of home depot .	male
i have a feeling , that these folks , are volunteers .	male
the room and furniture were old and low quality amenities in the rooms .	male
what my girlfriend complained about : the guacamole had too many onions .	male
the food took an incredibly long time to come out .	male
everyone else at the club was friendly , helpful , and welcoming .	male
but this in no way excuses her complete lack of professionalism .	male
unfortunately their quote was well above that of discount tire .	male
brats are basic , no-frills , and mediocre at best .	male
overpriced , horrible selection , and the quality was n't even very good .	male
then when they mess up they do nothing to make the customer satisfied .	male
the fried items can be a bit soggy from sitting out too long .	male
i walked around and just felt odd and out of place .	male
only eat here if you are stuck in this building and pressed for time .	male
the food here too lacked any unique presentation or flavor .	male
if i wanted more sauce i would have cost me an extra .	male
i finally visited this place for lunch with some co workers .	male
even worse the butter soaked farm raised salmon cubes were just luke warm .	male
on my last trip to this location i had a fairly typical experience .	male
service at this location seems to be a frequent issue .	male
however this is ass become less true over the recent years .	male
the one surprising thing is that i did not get sick .	male
servers too busy chatting , hiding , you name it .	male
this place must be under new management and wait staff .	male
i tell him to forget it as i will take my business elsewhere .	male
this same technique was used on me before a chinese restaurant in west phoenix .	male
i wish i could rate the food but not tonight .	male
if you are seeking quantity and not quality marigold should be consideration .	male
potatoes were burned to a crisp and eggs were not cooked fully .	male
this is n't just for premium parking , but its for general too .	male
for patrons that would benefit from seating this is unacceptable .	male
just be prepared for what you pay for ... cheap work .	male
i have stopped using this location and will not be using papa johns again .	male
guess freemont has them thinking they can lock shit down .	male
granted it was a monday night football , but staff accordingly .	male
i have given it several chances and nothing has changed .	male
i had to get my order custom made , and left kind of disappointed .	male
there is too much of a stuffy corporate feel here to have any fun .	male
all were very responsive and apologized for the substandard service .	male
i was not spicy , in fact the chicken is very bland .	male
nice patio , fair drinks , overpriced bad bland food .	male
while normally a fan of the keg , very disappointed today .	male
they do n't even wear gloves when making the food .	male
i will never buy anything is this place ever again .	male
this is only good pizza to people who have never had good pizza .	male
i thought the red was terrible and the white was less than average .	male
the sauce bothered me the entire evening , way too much paste .	male
the pho quality was somewhat substandard , salty , and lacked effort .	male
this place did not give a lot of meat either .	male
probably my last visit unless there is a serious change .	male
the store selling starbucks was adequate with a very helpful clerk .	male
there are much better places to eat at with much much better service .	male
club culture here is hit or miss ... mostly miss .	male
i was also wondering when the gang fight was going to break out .	male
the worst is this : they use styrofoam for everything .	male
ours did it and above or below was doing it as well .	male
i usually have better results and never have to worry .	male
then to top it off the remote does n't even work for the tv .	male
the place is very very old and looks kinda run down .	male
my first example of this is no more real perks .	male
decor is lacking greatly and the overall environment was quite dirty and messy .	male
which would n't have been a huge deal had they not been bone dry .	male
well it turns out the answer is indeed , no .	male
when i choose to spend it with you , act like you care .	male
at the same time , that is n't my problem .	male
food was good , but overall it was a very bad dining experience .	male
i tried three dishes each one was no better than microwave dim sum .	male
pay attention to the poor reviews on here , because they are spot on .	male
however , it is nothing special and definitely below average .	male
this is one of the worst gyms i have been a member of .	male
step up your game rainforest las vegas , mgm hotel .	male
btw the only saving grace to this whole experience was the very kind cashier .	male
last but not least , there was the dessert course .	male
basically , do n't honor this establishment with your business .	male
service was average , but nothing worth coming back for .	male
this is the second time this happened , first time to complain .	male
my story is that i went to there to get an alignment .	male
the champaign olive garden has declined significantly within the last year .	male
i guess the thing is that it did n't used to be this way .	male
they were n't short staffed , so why make it so hard ?	male
hotel staff and bus driver said this has happened numerous times .	male
noted they did not have proper equipment or body fluid pick up supplies ?	male
i went in this saturday morning hoping to avoid the lines at home depot .	male
i could n't wait to put the store in my rear view mirror .	male
it is kind of drab and has a tired and dated look .	male
you do n't need to have every possible dish on the menu .	male
given the quality of the food , it was ridiculously overpriced .	male
even outback looks like a five star restaurant compared to this place .	male
i ca n't believe people consider this a great authentic local spot .	male
fries were n't the fresh cut kind and the chocolate shake was bland .	male
backwards ran school setup to make things difficult on the student .	male
totally understaffed with only three people working and really slow .	male
i was unhappy with the service and the choice selection of the menu .	male
sure , i do n't mind that this one has food spilled on it .	male
i ca n't help but feel this restaurant has fooled many .	male
however , as time went on , the food quality slowly started to slip .	male
these guys literally did not want to sell me a car .	male
for new mexico food , visit the state of new mexico for the food .	male
i told the manager and she did n't really care to explain .	male
this was my first experience at the restaurant and i was far from impressed .	male
i would never do business with anyone at this firm again .	male
bottom line i would not recommend this shop to anyone .	male
the next morning i come out and two tires are completely flat .	male
dennis the assistant manager has to be the worst closer in the business .	male
two stars for edible food , ordinary service , with an ok ambience .	male
just dead , no crowd , no life , no interest from the bartender .	male
no tomatoes , no okra , no celery , no onions , nothing .	male
stand in line every where and three hours go by much faster .	male
the hotel website does not function with mobile phones for group reservations .	male
just want to qualify my review before i get into it .	male
i spoke to the hostesses and they were very friendly .	male
asked my wife how hers was , she said eh .	male
anyhow , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .	male
if it was annoying for us , imagine how they felt !	male
this is a total dump with average to bad food .	male
there are too many good chinese food options to return here .	male
the decor is old fashioned , stained carpeting , old waitresses .	male
the pizza was pedestrian at best and the lasagna was just down right bad .	male
adults may enjoy the museum , but kids will probably be pretty bored .	male
and because of their mistake that i have to pay extra to my contractor .	male
you get plenty of food for he money but it is mediocre food .	male
the friday night fish fry was way overpriced and nothing special .	male
not too impressed , there are much better mexican restaurants around .	male
the other burger is cold and the nachos are wrong .	male
after years of patronage , i wo n't be back for a while .	male
food is n't bad but nothing to get excited about .	male
this is by far the worst cracker barrel in arizona .	male
at this rate , another valley landmark might soon be going away .	male
do not get chicken as a pizza topping , its breaded chicken .	male
just leave them on the table then brush them aside .	male
no one bothered to help or track this guy down while i was waiting .	male
at this price point , the luxor is a much better deal .	male
one of the worst places on earth they lied and cheated me .	male
painfully blah , older business hotel that needs updates and upgrades .	male
someone needs to wake up , update , and start cooking with passion .	male
have they ever put a slab of cheese on it ?	male
the wings here are absolutely terrible and gave me diarrhea .	male
no flavor and the condiments that came with the burger were the standard fare .	male
the steak fries as a side should have stayed in the kitchen .	male
i guess they stopped doing it just a few weeks ago .	male
you have to try to find someone yourself , which is n't easy .	male
the food is pricey and rather average , with very greasy bacon .	male
so be very careful if you decide to go there .	male
the rumors were true , this place is overpriced and has terrible service .	male
service seems to really be going downhill at this place , which is sad .	male
the tacos were more lettuce than fish and the slaw was rather bland .	male
they also can use a better bbq sauce for it .	male
now back to the dirty dining situation this place could use some love .	male
sometimes these people forget what they do and who they work for .	male
i had a craving for pasta so i stopped by .	male
maybe their pizza is better , but i wont go back .	male
the selection of hot fish and shrimp dishes were more than normal .	male
the flavor of the dishes were average with nothing standing out .	male
typical mall restaurant , average food for above average prices .	male
i will only return for drinks and to soak up the atmosphere .	male
one might think there would be not much more to say .	male
no more tri color pizza and they changed the passion fruit iced tea .	male
if one of my guests smoke outside , that is none of their business !	male
one of the pork chops on our table was really dry .	male
bottom line : never hurts to try a new spot .	male
i got a police report and they still had to investigate it .	male
everything except the salad had far more salt than necessary or even reasonable .	male
below average the duck was cooked here yesterday or the day prior .	male
only came here because the other restaurants did n't open this early .	male
i always check every possible competitor before i am forced to shop here .	male
i like to talk to the person or people i am dining with .	male
the carpet looked like the floor of a new york taxi .	male
they push drinks and deserts to the point of being obnoxious .	male
hard to below they could not use the extra business .	male
for some reason , the chandler location just feels like something is n't right .	male
i do n't know is never an acceptable answer to a customer !	male
i strongly suspect that most yelp reviews on the steakhouse are not legitimate .	male
if you are wondering what select grade meat tastes like go here .	male
i called the driver back and told me i was n't there .	male
i strongly believe that with some dogs , less is more .	male
mediocre food , apathetic management , and a long wait for the food .	male
the prices were fair and the service was ok too .	male
you will be very dissapointed and your needs will not be met .	male
water and gas are super expensive - tank up before you cross the desert .	male
but stupid expensive drinks and the bartenders do not give very good service .	male
and only then if there is nothing else going on .	male
i was a regular until the new owners purchased the business .	male
over by the side wall it sounded like a mess .	male
this is easily the worst golf course i have ever played .	male
second , the layout is dangerous , especially on the back nine .	male
we figured , why not try a more traditional chinese place ?	male
no eggs , baby corn , or anything else that might be interesting .	male
none of the pies looked particularly interesting ; i went with the vegetarian .	male
called to discuss bill never received a return call from billing department .	male
however , they kept asking for more , each time they failed to perform .	male
i will remember this the next time i decide where to shop .	male
that was a bad sign but decided to give it a try anyway .	male
my advice is to just go some place else and save yourself the headache .	male
they do n't even have white sauce ... like japanese say what .	male
do n't know what that meant ; did they run out of spinach ?	male
this is by far the worst restaurant i have visited .	male
if only they could pick me up on the way back .	male
so i am left with yellow cab most of the time .	male
and get your credit card machine fixed , you fool .	male
getting my car washed there is too much work for me .	male
the waiter did n't even check in on us while we were eating .	male
she said , no i meant these are the wrong sauces .	male
thanks for making bad memories one lousy service person at a time .	male
to be a gracious host while i spend my damn hard earned money .	male
food is ok but not worth a trip over to this joint .	male
but the killer was the smell of the oil on the bread .	male
the nurse finally returned like it was no big deal .	male
just to let you know , this is no exaggeration !	male
no have a nice night , just in out gone .	male
the green chili has gone down hill you can tell they are cutting corners .	male
satisfied ... yes , but overall , what a waste of a time .	male
i think the deep fried oreo down the street is better for you .	male
no calls to say they were late or to apologize .	male
but i can assure you that the calzones are not worth it .	male
but do not expect a lovely waitress to meet your needs .	male
but , yelp felt the need that all business deserve pity stars .	male
had a pizza , the spaghetti with sausage , side salads and garlic knots .	male
spaghetti sauce was eh as well , and not enough .	male
the food was average , the service was slow and the decor was old .	male
no one came by to refill glasses until she again caught someone passing by .	male
pretty ridiculous when i get the coupon from their own web site .	male
on any other day i would have passed on eating here .	male
meh , i wo n't be bringing people around here anymore .	male
but for goodness sake do not go there for the coffee .	male
then adding insult to injury the food was bland when it arrived .	male
the korean bbq restaurant is next door and kitchen is same for both .	male
very average , not great flavor , but not bad .	male
obviously this staff is not capable of handling a full house .	male
the cashier was new so someone helped him which was fine .	male
the bun came out soggy and the sandwich did not hold very well together .	male
i could cook a meal faster than they could acknowledge and seat me .	male
food and service are below average for this price level , period .	male
if anything , you should check these guys out for that .	male
where this terminal is the best is in the choice of food and drinks .	male
the flip side is that there is one bar and it is lame .	male
the one thing that stood out was the chunky bleu cheese dressing .	male
the food is good but nothing to write home about .	male
very slow service , had to get our own drink refills .	male
the pizza was overly salty , the crust was hard and tasted very bad .	male
the food is average at best , the service is beyond slow .	male
nothing about it was worth the time or the money .	male
so over price that i can not afford a drink .	male
this place has really fallen down since i last ate here .	male
in-n-out makes a better burger and is half the price .	male
one of my buddies got a hot bowl with cold soup .	male
so someone my girlfriend knew said that this was the place to try .	male
as a result , i have fallen a couple of times .	male
i really do n't get what the big deal is with this place .	male
i drove by here a few times so i tried it out .	male
the kids dug in , but i had a turkey sandwich .	male
off the beaten path so do n't go looking for this place .	male
this place does not qualify as a restaurant , mexican or otherwise .	male
if a customer comes into the service area , you do n't ignore them .	male
this place sucks the cashiers are either very rude , slow and incompetent .	male
this guy actually did n't even know the menu period .	male
its hard to be a worst walmart but this one is up there .	male
we would have a drink empty and wait and have no waiter show up .	male
like i said the food was amazingly good but the service was very poor .	male
then yet another rude deli employee proceeded to reluctantly take care of my order .	male
save your money and your appetite for the other foodie places in clt .	male
i have called at least three times and complained and nothing has changed .	male
i should n't have to get a manager involved every time .	male
the place is outdated and in need of a remodel .	male
the wings were fatty and had very little sauce on them .	male
this is a negative review warning people that they auto gratuity your check .	male
terrible service , asked for a refill on my water and never received it .	male
never again ... i encourage the same to anyone searching .	male
they give every guy the exact same haircut no matter what you ask for .	male
then after i fed my kids the crap they gave me .	male
they get you in , let you join , all with no issue .	male
prices are way too high for the quality of food they are selling .	male
i know their rent may be high , but their prices are like stupid .	male
blooming onion was overcooked to the point of tasting burnt .	male
that and none of the food really had any flavor to speak of .	male
the only high point of the meal was the lobster mac and cheese .	male
i was in champaign last week , on a wednesday evening .	male
the bad : extremely poor value for money , in my opinion .	male
i returned to the store with my now cold pancakes .	male
warning do not purchase any used car from bmw of henderson .	male
this was the worst restaurant i have ever been to .	male
the buffalo sauce tasted more like a tangy syrup or something similar of .	male
we would not go again , having experienced far better .	male
no theme to the casino as opposed to other hotels .	male
the gambling options are limited and the slots are outdated .	male
go to pei wei and have the same food for less money .	male
perhaps too quickly , as the salsa mixture was not explained .	male
i walked in and was seated , ordered a coke .	male
eventually meat made its way over on skewers ... slowly .	male
had the monthly payment program for express washes on my last car .	male
the shop is your average pawn shop a bit dingy and old looking .	male
usually they wrap a napkin or something so you do n't burn yourself .	male
but none of them were their and this was our out come !	male
probably the worst airport in terms of signage in the us .	male
once you exit the airport there are no signs to find a taxi .	male
no wonder your turn over is higher then pop in fresh .	male
i have to do my stomach a favor and not touch this food again .	male
but ... i wanted to like this place and i ca n't .	male
all in all , i wo n't come back here .	male
she was only trying to avoid the taste of the tap .	male
the only difference is that jesse and frank did n't have a website !	male
never have coffee brewed and the employees ignore you when you come in .	male
the eggs were bland , the cheese basic , and the steak questionable .	male
and do n't bother trying to warm up at the practice facility .	male
dirty , if your not busy clean your damn store .	male
im sure it was just an isolated incident - but they handled it poorly .	male
the flavors were very bland and the veggies tasted soggy and stale .	male
it is cheap italian food , but friendly and fast .	male
however , the rug was supposed to be arriving the first week of march .	male
the server did n't arrive at the table for close to five minutes .	male
the food was n't great by any stretch of the imagination .	male
let me start by saying , i did n't pay for my meal .	male
i drink beer so ill still be a paying customer .	male
no one was shooting on it because the lights where burnt out above it .	male
i stopped going to this place after the unpleasant experience .	male
sadly this place did not really live up the the reviews .	male
i talked to arcade tech and he said that is what the game does .	male
i do n't see what all the hype is about .	male
there is nothing special about this restaurant , it is mediocre at best .	male
no star is my rating , but i have to select something .	male
as casinos go , this one really has little going for it .	male
clearly a chef who takes no pride in what leaves the kitchen .	male
the chicken king right down the street from me is a much better choice .	male
oscar said the car was out of warranty but i could contact toyota directly .	male
this trip did n't make sense and they did n't really seem to care .	male
it was soft , well cooked , etc , no flavor .	male
this place exists to suck the most money out of your pocket as possible .	male
this whole place is a scam designed to take your money .	male
they received confirmation from my insurance stating that services would be covered .	male
they then claimed the insurance denied coverage and demanded payment .	male
it was n't bad per se , but it was n't good either .	male
we left with the hungry feeling gone but certainly no feeling of satisfaction either .	male
the food is usually below average and the workers barely speak english .	male
the gluten-free however , came out with the crust burned .	male
in summary , i know my watch was not off .	male
okay , so lets talk about what matters , service , atmosphere and food .	male
and it just was n't one pizza , it was all three .	male
manager was n't much help , offer a free beer or dessert will ya ?	male
ordered the links over easy with rye toast and hash browns .	male
no offer of any form of compensation for the trouble .	male
the bean burrito was ok but i had them add sour cream and guacamole .	male
the prices were way too high for this low quality of food .	male
no complaints about the food except the house salad had a really sour taste .	male
now , this franchise has started charging for red peppers and cheese packets .	male
literally had to tell her every aspect of her job , step by step .	male
stay away from this restaurant until they fix their issues .	male
my steak and the rest of my friends steak were not cooked to order .	male
their customer service skills are way below par for being in the medical industry .	male
the curly fries were good , but the sliders was sub-par .	male
this is the first time i have not left a tip at a restaurant .	male
the owner suddenly became defensive about the mickey mouse job that they had done .	male
it is that bad of a car to begin with .	male
this place sucks i am a person and will not be treated this way .	male
they only came and addressed one or two things after i filed the papers .	male
my wife would n't let me wear jeans but we saw diners wearing jeans .	male
a few minutes later my dish returned and it was only slightly more cooked .	male
the blackened ahi was cold in spots and warm in spots .	male
i hate this airport almost as much as i hate charlotte .	male
i figured most vegas buffets include drinks in the price .	male
once again , it was a chewy , mediocre seasoned piece of meat .	male
avoid this place find someplace else to spend your dining dollars .	male
unless you know exactly where something is do n't waste your time here .	male
horrible service and cheap food trying to be passed off as high end .	male
the sushi was worse than the stuff you buy from the grocery store .	male
i have no idea of why i was stupid enough to just walk out .	male
the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .	male
i would n't go out of my way to go back anytime soon .	male
i just had the worst experience i have ever had at a retail store .	male
when i went back with my wife , the treatment was completely different .	male
my waiter was friendly enough but the food was just ok .	male
several saw me and passed by yet none stopped to ask about my order .	male
the place was not cleaned prior to us moving in .	male
one said i needed a picture of my pet , the next did n't .	male
they make money and you get sub par service here .	male
same price , better service , and a hell of a lot nicer .	male
the problems i had was the food had little to no flavor .	male
we went twice and tried different things with the same level of disappointment .	male
the place really needs a good cleaning before i will go back again .	male
a seriously overpriced and way too pretentious b & b .	male
absolutely not , you will be overcharged , and ripped off .	male
do n't let few people in the waiting room fool you .	male
the meat was below average and did n't taste fresh .	male
if you want good bbq , go to little miss bbq !	male
the beef was bland and had did n't have much flavor .	male
the ingredients were n't fresh and the food was n't cooked properly .	male
unfortunately when i need az aaa they let me down .	male
tastes bland and a bit stale as if it was sitting around for awhile .	male
this is the third and final time i will set foot in this location .	male
i do n't understand why it was not delivered promptly to my room .	male
unfortunately , the adjustments he performed on me made my condition worse .	male
everything about this place screams a budget hotel , except for the price .	male
i felt bad because i took my coworkers there with me .	male
the only good thing i have found was the nice outdoor dining patio .	male
it never seems like they care about you giving service quality poor .	male
the rooms are just worn out and in mighty need of a facelift .	male
what a bunch of , well , use your favorite word .	male
the only redeeming quality of this place was the shake .	male
the only saving grace of this place was the shake .	male
i do n't understand why this place is so popular .	male
if you do n't have a reservation do n't show up .	male
you would have known had you followed up as you said you would .	male
have eaten here a couple of times and have been fairly pleased .	male
later , after no other food , stomach problems and out it came .	male
no apology , no can i get you a fresh bun , no nothing .	male
go to frys they know how to treat the customer .	male
i feel sorry for anyone that has to work with her .	male
the food is okay - typical italian fair that could be better seasoned .	male
you have to be really wasted if you think this place is good .	male
food was not very fresh especially seafood used in the salads and spring rolls .	male
stay away and give your hard earned money to a business that deserves it .	male
check negative reviews on bbb site and here on yelp .	male
do n't know how they can get coffee wrong , but they do .	male

old , dusty , very tired decor .	female

i mean , come on .	female
the service was mediocre .	female
the food was horrible .	female
i ca n't believe it .	female
this was just over the top awful .	female

all-in-all , it was a disappointing experience .	female
dry gross and gross .	female
the room itself was okay .	female
however , the front desk associate was not .	female
the buffet was terrible .	female
the bread sticks were pretty good though .	female
last week we flew from phoenix to florida .	female

i would never return to this place .	female
however , the meal was absolutely tasteless .	female
needless to say we will not be going back .	female
i wo n't be back again .	female
the service was extremely slow .	female
service was incredibly slow .	female
our tv was an old school tv .	female
when our drinks came , we were quite disappointed .	female

total waste of money .	female
i probably will not go back .	female
trying another store instead .	female
it was huge chunks of old salmon with mayo .	female

i probably would not go back .	female
rude , rude , rude .	female

i would not go there again .	female
i was thoroughly disappointed .	female
do n't waste your time with this company .	female
service was extremely rushed .	female

would i like to complain ?	female
i felt bad for her .	female

this evening it was nothing like our previous experience .	female

the server said no problem .	female
the food was cold .	female
it was not a pleasant experience .	female
the wild rice was overcooked and extremely salty .	female
they were dry and gross !	female
i am so frustrated !	female
none at all today .	female
not great but good .	female
some animals were out but most were not .	female
i would give zero stars if possible !	female
i was so sad .	female
wo n't go back again .	female
slow and unfriendly service .	female
this place was such a huge disappointment .	female
i probably wo n't go back to find out .	female
this place is an absolute nightmare .	female
this place was not packed .	female
she was absolutely horrible .	female
very disappointing and will never go back .	female
the waitstaff is hit or miss .	female
food and service mediocre .	female
this place has terrible food !	female
i will never return unless it changes owners .	female
the ick : the bathrooms were horrendous .	female
not my cup of tea .	female
it was just gross .	female
did n't they close already ?	female
we were both disappointed by the very small servings .	female
the portion sizes of these plates were underwhelming .	female
greasy , gross , packaged mix flavors .	female
only for the pomegranate smoothie .	female
we ordered apps , salads , wine and entrees .	female
this whole store was disappointing i guess .	female
the rice was flavorless .	female
they do not stand by their products .	female
this review is long overdue .	female
my wild rice was super dry .	female
the small salad was n't their best .	female
i did n't really care because i was hungry .	female
bacon was crispy , not microwaved like ihop does .	female
we topped off our own wine glasses every time .	female
not in my humble opinion .	female
no offer to get a membership .	female
i will not stay here again .	female
he just ignored us the entire time !	female
we shared some chocolate dessert , which was good .	female
very hit or miss .	female
i will not return to this location .	female
this location is terrible .	female
this was not the case at all .	female
totally not worth the drive from scottsdale .	female
they do n't mind blood on the box spring .	female
the scheduling here is a nightmare .	female
but not the horrible treatment .	female
that does n't bother me .	female
service was a little slow .	female
then he walked off .	female
it was truly sad to see .	female
monday came and obviously i was never contacted .	female
i was very uncomfortable .	female
i was n't impressed at all .	female
prices were very reasonable .	female
i would give zero stars if possible .	female
everything else was mediocre .	female
as it was , we wo n't come back .	female
what a let down .	female
i was very disappointed with this property .	female
i will never go back to this place again .	female
this was not a pleasant experience .	female
never ordering from here again .	female
from the start she was not very friendly .	female
she did n't smile .	female
probably wo n't be coming back .	female
first off , the service is horrible .	female
if i could give no stars , i would .	female
she had the worst attitude .	female
it was so bland .	female
terrible food and service .	female
they were completely dry and almost inedible .	female
wish i had n't met them at the tuscany .	female
she was in pain .	female
oh such a disappointment .	female
after that , it all went downhill .	female
why would i want to stay there again ?	female
the food is pretty horrible too .	female
it did n't get any better with salt .	female
she is impossible to talk to at the window .	female
the staff were rude .	female
however , my husband enjoyed his stuffed shells .	female
riviera is old tacky and lousy .	female
dirty , dirty , dirty .	female
also , it made my tummy hurt .	female
she never said anything to me .	female
i do not recommend this hotel .	female
the penguin is not what it used to be .	female
a major disappointment after the other positive reviews .	female
too much water and cooked too long .	female
somehow , they messed up the rice too .	female
wo n't be coming back anytime soon .	female
your menu is n't that big !	female
their er is even worse !	female
not happy and not coming back .	female
the selection of things was n't that impressive .	female

she was n't kidding .	female
we will not return .	female
i could not make this up .	female
atmosphere is awesome ... food is terrible .	female
not a fan of that .	female
unfortunately , we were highly disappointed !	female
he was very unprofessional and rude .	female
wo n't be coming here again .	female
the receptionists agreed that this was unacceptable .	female
i was not a fan .	female
needless to say , we left without buying .	female
prices are very inexpensive .	female
the lady was extremely rude on the phone .	female
i would n't stay here again .	female
they should be embarrassed .	female
more significantly , they simply were n't very flavorful .	female
i will not be back !	female
not for the people .	female
i stayed in a queen tower suite .	female
the service is n't that great either .	female
i wish i had better things to say .	female
i almost walked out .	female
this costco is the worst .	female
i will not go back there .	female
unfortunately , we probably wo n't be back .	female
not good at all .	female
no room cleaning , nothing .	female
we will not go back .	female
my boyfriend isnt picky about food .	female
all of it was mediocre at best .	female
however , the rice was bland .	female
we were beyond disappointed .	female
more food was out and it was better .	female
this company is very unprofessional .	female
the whole experience was terrible .	female
i would not come here again .	female
the food was warm and nothing was heating it .	female
he told me that i should buy it elsewhere .	female
did n't care for it !	female
but never once offered to help me .	female
the customer service was so-so .	female
not appealing at all .	female
i have never been so insulted in my life .	female
i tried the sushi and regretted it immediately .	female
i wo n't be visiting again .	female
it was just bland .	female
they were not even that busy .	female
never coming back here again .	female
do not waste your time !	female
the staff was simply rude to us .	female
i just used my iphone !	female
do n't ask me why .	female
hotel employees are not professional .	female
staff was not pleasant to say the least .	female
terrible terrible terrible horrible customer service !	female
i thought the menu was boring and very limited .	female
overall i was n't very happy with my experience .	female
not very friendly at all .	female
he refused to give them to me .	female
parking is very limited .	female
avoid it like the plague .	female
do n't think we will be back .	female
his side of mac and cheese was laughable .	female
i had the eggs benedict .	female
just do n't do it .	female
the girl at the counter was very rude .	female
there is no excuse .	female
not acceptable to me .	female
i was so mad .	female
i was terribly disappointed .	female
i would not call back .	female
how can you mess up a simple cheeseburger and chicken finger ?	female
not that we would have used it , but the pool was closed .	female
i feel bad for the waitresses that have to work their .	female
i know that was really rude , and there is no excuse .	female
there was n't enough cheese and the cheese that was there was just blah .	female
i did n't want to put him through that again on another day .	female
later we got called at the counter to get our pizzas .	female
i was starving and could n't even bring myself to finish a single piece .	female
the people who clean can see it , why do n't they remove it .	female
i do n't get it , i just do n't .	female
i have never been treated so rudely in my life .	female
slow service , and the food certainly does n't make up for it .	female
the last time was most upsetting and made me decide to never return .	female
why the heck people think gluten-free food has to taste bland is beyond me .	female
the staff was pretty unfriendly , i did n't feel welcome there .	female
he ended up getting mad at me because he could n't find my check .	female
we have never been treated so terribly by staff at a restaurant .	female
i was so livid i threw the jeans down and walked out .	female
went over year ago and was disappointed in the shrimp and grits .	female
ummm no it was more like a tortilla bread wrap of some sort .	female
the ice cream was not necessary and almost too sweet .	female
i ordered the seabass and it really was n't anything spectacular .	female
the server apologized and offered to get the correct sandwhich for me to go .	female
my husband , son , and i went to have breakfast one saturday morning .	female
the coffee and water in your room are not complimentary .	female
if you want a quiet bar , do n't have a karaoke night .	female
needless to say , i will never order an office lunch from them again .	female
they used a different bread that was way too thick and not even toasted .	female
so , i stopped by here since it was so close .	female
i do n't like paying for an expensive meal that is not good .	female
however , as sad as it is , it can not be avoided .	female
i left the store and i will never do business with walker again .	female
the attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream .	female
before our food arrived , we asked for the bill to cancel our order .	female
it still does n't give you the right to be rude .	female
it makes me wonder if all the staff and medical staff are like this .	female
never even came back to the register or apologized for the wait .	female
she said she could go to the back and get us some .	female
fried dumplings were way too doughy and the sauce was way too bland .	female
i suggest going anywhere else other than here , if you possibly can !	female
our server was lots of fun and very professional , but a little slow .	female
the whole hotel feels like it has n't been cleaned in a long time .	female
nostalgia would not be enough to bring me back to this place .	female
stop in on a whim to pick up some pizzas .	female
when i told her , she near argued with me .	female
the sweet and sour chicken was bright pink and more onion than anything else .	female
all in all this location is horrible , rude and messy .	female
i found it pretty low quality , not very fresh , kind of greasy .	female
the biggest upset was our takeout order did not come with chips .	female
they give hardly any feedback about what to do if scheduling appointments .	female
no crab legs , no shrimp , nothing but sushi .	female
the bus got to phoenix , and there my son stayed !	female
no problem , i can wait a few extra days .	female
every time we went to this location , they screwed up our order .	female
the mozzarella cheese sticks were not cooked and taste horrible .	female
service kinda sucks here and the works are kinda rude .	female
young people who are clueless as far as serving goes .	female
it was quite watery with very little meat in it .	female
warning : they do n't clean the rooms very well .	female
if only i can give no star , i would .	female
we did n't even bother trying to make our way into the buffet .	female
my husband makes way better carne asada , cooked to perfection .	female
i expected better quality of service during my visit but was very disappointed .	female
i probably would n't go back here because it was n't even peak hours !	female
i did n't even know what fine dining was until college .	female
i gave half of it to my husband to eat .	female
i wanted to like this place , but it just did n't come together .	female
the restaurant was not busy , and not even half full .	female
i do n't know how she made me feel like i should apologize .	female
however , after the service we received tonight , we will not back .	female
they would n't do a full refund as we ate some of the pizza .	female
i got the bbq sampler thing and my husband got nachos .	female
do n't waste your time or money at this place .	female
went here , was n't aware of what time they close .	female
three of the steaks were dried out pieces of leather .	female
no sauce and no chocolate pastry to be found in my bag .	female
the room reeked like a dive bar on a sunday morning .	female
this is by far the worst place to get boba teas .	female
the food was n't horrible but it was just bland and boring .	female
however , we went with friends last night and the food was terribly disappointing !	female
i dropped off my computer with mike and went to another appointment .	female
is is awful customer service , and the people do not wear gloves .	female
you can see almost all of phx from that spot !	female
the rest of the casino / hotel felt dirty , old and uncomfortable .	female
so the salesman sent me to another store down the street from them .	female
the rooms were clearly updated but were still somewhat gross and musty inside .	female
well got sauce for breadsticks it was cold , bummer .	female
was n't the best , but way better than the butter !	female
the eggs were fine and maybe had a little seasoning to them .	female
i saw many glowing reviews on yelp & was looking forward to this meal .	female
this means for over a month i will have no refrigerator .	female
all in all i wish we would have gone to ichiza down the street .	female
my thanksgiving dinner was so cold i sent it back .	female
the wraps for the moo shu made me feel like i was eating paper .	female
i will never go back to a umc quick care .	female
never brought more bread when he said he was going to get it .	female
made me feel bad for wanting to look at menu .	female
what chinese restaurant charges you for rice with sweet and sour chicken ?	female
after leaving i thought i could not come back to stay here unless free .	female
refried beans were good , but tasted like they came from a can .	female
just like jesse above , i neither want to rate this company .	female
i would n't recommend it nor will i be returning .	female
never offered to fix me something else but did offer dessert ... .	female
i called once and gave my address and they confirmed they would deliver .	female
told my husband to hit the rain locker because he stunk .	female
the manager was extremely rude about me receiving cold pizza .	female
free eggroll with yelp check-in and buy one get one free drink ?	female
so do not even think of setting up an automatic payment plan .	female
and not because it was rotten , but because it was that bad .	female
we went to outback for dinner on friday for dinner and were sorely disappointed !	female
service is awful and the food was just as bad .	female
thank god i live in california where they actually care about the patients .	female
if you love your family ... do n't take them here .	female
the room appeared to be clean and modern but the beds were awful .	female
i only ate half of it and sadly threw it out !	female
store is always as absolute mess every time we are in there .	female
he responded as loud as i was by asking me to leave .	female
i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !	female
to much dressing on the salad and no sauce on the ziti .	female
looks to me the lady on the phone does n't care much about business !	female
its soo crowded with the sick til it just seems unsanitary .	female
nothing to complain about , but nothing to rave about either .	female
i told him that salmon does not take this long to grill .	female
i went cobblestone last weekend and had the worst wash of my life .	female
literally two minutes from my old home and we were desperate .	female
excuse me , i wanted to talk to management , not her .	female
so when the drinks came out everyone else got their drinks except me .	female
the chef , however , needs a bit of training .	female
the only thing i ended up eating was the egg rolls .	female
if i could give this hotel a negative star rating , i would .	female
the rice is hard and the fish is not fresh .	female
now i see why u guys have so bad reviews !	female
the first time was fine - not particularly good , not particularly bad .	female
the room i was in definitely had not been renovated in decades .	female
my hands were full so they said they would send someone up .	female
we got there and got stuck with a smoking room .	female
they also claimed they ran out of pillows and could n't provide anymore .	female
the waiter never checked back in nor did the manager .	female
i try to avoid going to urgent care unless i am dying .	female
the staff we talked to seemed to lack product knowledge .	female
my chai latte was pale and very close to the hue of milk .	female
if i was n't so hungry i would n't have eaten them at all !	female
now i am terrified that more stores exist out there like this one .	female
they are known for having thin , smashed , juicy meat and tasty fries .	female
the other lady was trying to rush through the busy line .	female
i used to refer this clinic , but no longer will .	female
we went on saturday night , no wait but extremely busy .	female
an apology would have been nice , however we did n't receive that either .	female
the girl at the front desk was rude and seemed miserable .	female
they came quickly - only three days from when we reported the problem .	female
i usually drive around a couple times to get a gas pump .	female
so , we went on the busiest day of the week , sunday .	female
lackluster , boring , unimpressive , less than inspired , and fishy smelling .	female
lots of room , it really filled up the longer we were there .	female
so i left my name and number for them to call me back .	female
a companion ordered a plain cheeseburger and it was loaded with onions .	female
when i arrived they had no appt and acted like it was my fault .	female
the girl who took our order should not have been working the register .	female
walked in the restaurant from the mall entrance and you could smell fish .	female
this morning , my third morning , i was doing yoga on the floor .	female
once we got our food my mothers was cold and was n't right .	female
we are poor , but i would never waste my money here .	female
the other time , i ordered bacon pancakes which were just ok .	female
the spanish rice was mediocre and there were green beans in it ?	female
then i ordered the salmon miso with rice and veggies .	female
food was good but the fry rice was a little under cooked .	female
the service was not very helpful or friendly in my eyes .	female
horrible , inexcusable service every single time i have gone .	female
yes , just because i have no choice but to use this store .	female
guess i will stick to amazon from now on though .	female
forget the lettuce for my to go lettuce wraps once , shame on you .	female
we get our bags head to the elevator and bam , elevator is broke .	female
there were children everywhere , which i think is completely inappropriate for vegas .	female
what ruined the experience for me was the customer service .	female
i had the short stack of pancakes , and only got through half .	female
the bartender was helpful in trying to accommodate me with something to drink .	female
the casino itself is small and there are more tables than slot machines .	female
if i could give this hotel a negative star , i would !	female
ok , i can see that but i have a reservation .	female
so we had to leave the tire and went back to work .	female
mistakes happen and we would have understood if they had been apologetic and accommodating .	female
i sent the fried perch back in hopes of getting something hot .	female
what i got was room temperature , soggy , fried cinnamon bread .	female
i am pregnant and did not feel like standing in a packed bar .	female
needless to say we were very disappointed in our dinner .	female
i was never warned that they heat their dip up so hot .	female
i went back to the restaurant and tried to explain the situation .	female
but since having a baby i ca n't get enough of it .	female
but i was so excited for the food that i looked past this .	female
came home to find the sundae nearly melted and there was n't enough fudge .	female
all she did was apologize and said that i am sorry that happened .	female
if you are late for an appointment , they will either cut your appt .	female
the syrup was so thin it was like pouring water .	female
never ever going back , and definitely would not recommend the place after this .	female
if i could give this zero stars , i would .	female
for entrees , i ordered pad see ew and my bf ordered pad thai .	female
do n't use their service if you do n't have to .	female
i was very disappointed in the food for the cost of it .	female
when i complained , she said they had a reservation .	female
will i be calling the main office of greyhound demanding a partial refund ?	female
anyone who gave this place above two stars does not have taste buds .	female
i did n't realize that they gave me zucchini until i took a bite .	female
during a second experience , i had gucci sunglasses with scratched lenses .	female
hubby ordered the pepper beef and it was n't too bad .	female
horrible parking and service , staff ignored us as soon as we walked in .	female
the bacon pieces were very crisp though , so that was good .	female
how does a pizza hut run out of garlic breadsticks & medium crust ?	female
the rest of the restaurant was fine but the entry area was insane .	female
i got the nachos both time but i take most stuff off .	female
i know this mall is ghetto because it is in the ghetto .	female
the first thing she asked , who much money do you have .	female
also , tonight when we went there , the portion sizes actually got smaller .	female
i was shocked by the way she even responded as it was not friendly .	female
after reading reviews on yelp we decided to try this place .	female
my boyfriend and i have been coming to this place for a long time .	female
the person who took my information was polite and helpful .	female
she then said she could not seat us if everyone was n't there .	female
i gave two stars because our server was nice and we were seated immediately .	female
he did not smile the entire time and gave us an attitude .	female
so we went back and looked there but was nothing that we wanted .	female
with all the good reviews me and my bf decide to try it out .	female
the outer parts were overcooked and the inside was raw !	female
my huevos rancheros had a weak red sauce with no flavor .	female
it is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food .	female
the food looked great , but was cold and really substandard .	female
someone finally walked to the register to take my order .	female
he just began arguing that he was not being rude to me .	female
the manager jose came and was rude but at the end made an exception .	female
the chicken was n't as flavorful as i was hoping .	female
then she proceeded to make jokes that were completely lost on us .	female
this was the worst customer service i have ever experienced !	female
terrible , i should of read all the reviews first .	female
i have spend my whole day off from work sick as ever .	female
i really wanted to like this place , but i could n't .	female
it looked like she was pouring from a small tea pot .	female
easter brunch - i was so looking forward to this .	female
they are nuts - so i need to really put energy out there now .	female
tried this place out for date night with the husband and it was garbage .	female
for all those reasons , we wo n't go back .	female
the pizza came and the crust was anything but , more like bread .	female
the filling is decent , however the crust is just awful .	female
the extra charge for refills on drinks was kind of unnecessary .	female
another appointment was setup , and yet again no call and no show .	female
it would have been nice for customers and workers to have some ac going .	female
overall : the rooms were fine but the customer service was appalling .	female
boba was a disgusting mush and had absolutely no flavor or chew .	female
wo n't be going back and definitely wo n't be recommending it to anyone .	female
it just did n't leave a good taste in our mouths .	female
they did n't even get order correct to begin with .	female
it seems the staff was busy counting cookies and not waiting on tables .	female
had to call off it was just to cold out !	female
way over priced for such a dump with nasty food .	female
i know i am not only person that misses firefly .	female
as we left the person i was with commented on it too .	female
plus , the bath drain would get clogged and fill up during a shower .	female
plus my husband was out of water and she had n't come around .	female
not only that but apparently they have a little bee problem .	female
we were so insanely late to the meeting we missed the entire thing .	female
however , due to the slow service we will not try this place again .	female
when i inquired to ensure my tire rotation was complete he said no .	female
i ask for a manager because clearly she is incompetent .	female
the pho soup was super sweet , either too much sugar or msg .	female
for entrees , i had the paella and dh had the duck .	female
i took one bite and did n't eat any more .	female
i went inside to get it fixed , and they forgot about me .	female
everything that comes out of her mouth is not genuine .	female
some of her fries were wet and mushy from the butter .	female
had i know this i would have went to a different hospital .	female
do n't get me wrong , i do n't mind spending money .	female
he was very cold & asked the service rep what model car i had .	female
do n't get me started on how oily the las vegas roll was .	female
what was outrageous was that the horrible way the owner treated us .	female
otherwise , standard menu , sub-par food , and sub-par service .	female
there were at least three servers and only ten tables .	female
but the service and attitude of this bartender was horrendous .	female
i do n't do dairy , so asked for no cheese .	female
she told me if i ate even one bite she was unable to .	female
unfortunately we were seated in an odd area in the back of the restaurant .	female
that is the only activity at the hotel that is free of charge .	female
service was quick but then again there was n't too many patrons to serve .	female
the greens are even lighter in color and less crunchy .	female
i would go back , just hopefully get a different server .	female
i was very disappointed with how gucci in scottsdale treated me .	female
i spoke with a manager , erica martin about our happy hour drinks .	female
the hotel does n't look that great or fancy from the outside .	female
then got rude when we tried to explain what happened and yelled at us .	female
i got a salad to go and was disappointed when i got home .	female
my locker had trash inside it , and the steam room was broken .	female
their prices are cheap , and our food was just ok .	female
i can not begin to tell you how much i despise these people .	female
they gave me chewy bacon when i asked for extra crispy .	female
this used to be our favorite asian buffet in town , not any more !	female
all in all , you get what you pay for .	female
she continued to shout and is just flat out rude .	female
but i have expected my car to be broken into in the morning .	female
i think this is the only way we all could stand the atmosphere .	female
do n't waste your time or money on this place !	female
they even wanted to charge me for having to mix extra hair dye .	female
my boyfriend and i went here for my birthday , last night .	female
they cleaned my dress and burned the arm then tried to cover it up .	female
yes it was used but they said everything was good , everything got fixed .	female
i usually like shopping at michaels but i just do n't like this store .	female
they charge for everything , fries , toppings , everything is extra .	female
the only plus side was the bacon on the sandwich that was cooked correctly .	female
i turned around and saw it was inches away from me .	female
kids were running around everywhere screaming at all hours of the night .	female
try not to go to the er on a friday night .	female
i walked into the store , nobody greeted me at all .	female
went into ra to grab a drink with a few friends .	female
my vegetables that accompanied my dish were mostly just a pile of red onions .	female
i personally feel like a school cafeteria is better than this place .	female
overpriced food , lousy wine selection and not even a friendly neighborhood atmosphere .	female
she even rushed out a man in a wheel chair !	female
our server was pleasant but that was not enough to make us go back .	female
very very disappointed in this place , where do i begin .	female
we never saw the other appetizer ... like we never even ordered it .	female
i really would love to give a better rating to a vegan restaurant .	female
the restaurant itself was dirty , smelled funny and had bad service .	female
what gets me , is that i did n't even get an apology .	female
when i did eat there , the food really was n't that great .	female
the management does n't care about your living situations and are so disrespectful .	female
i went back the next day to see if they could fix it .	female
we should have been tipped off by the fact that it was empty .	female
if i could give my experience at this airport a zero i would .	female
so far , we have been unable to resolve this in a reasonable way .	female
but like the garlic knots , the dough itself offered very little flavor .	female
this is not the case at this particular location in the scottsdale fashion square .	female
i do not recommend this jeweler based on their very poor customer service .	female
the food was tasty , but the service was atrocious .	female
but the night took a turn for the worse when the entertainment started .	female
only went once and was not really impressed enough to try it again .	female
the breading on the chicken was super thick and hard crunchy .	female
she only returned to take my order when the manager told her to .	female
they have made the decision that you do not get bags .	female
this is not the first time this location has had problems .	female
we finally get walked to our table and he does n't tell us anything .	female
we have been screwed more times than we can count by this horrible airline .	female
the person i talked to on the phone was extremely rude .	female
the owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service .	female
they ignored me and came to find out i was allergic to it .	female
the food was not edible at all , very disappointing .	female
there was also dead roaches and bugs under the stove !	female
she said they could do the work and i could wait around three hours .	female
the dinner we had was awful and the gambling sucked .	female
they need lots of training in customer service and guest satisfaction .	female
the interior of this restaurant is just a huge mess .	female
however , it was not worth it to travel that far .	female
i was disgusted and asked for a refund which took forever .	female
both the mens and ladies restrooms were had toilets overflowing no soap or towels .	female
rolls were not good and fish did n't taste fresh .	female
so do n't go there unless you want terrible service .	female
i totally understand that they are just avoiding people parking .	female
the front desk girl a few different times was n't friendly at all .	female
my hubby called to say he could n't stay there .	female
ca n't beat that ... except maybe with a couple of rounds of patron .	female
most of the food was neither moroccan nor particularly tasty .	female
i ca n't describe how filthy and out dated everything is .	female
they treated us really bad and we had to leave .	female
most of the potatoes were crunchy , so i was not impressed .	female
this is the worst vegas experience i have ever had .	female
i did n't eat more than three bites of the rice .	female
i never got a call and a repair was never made .	female
i was so worried i was going to get ill after eating it .	female
the waitress did admit to forgetting his order which her honesty was appreciated .	female
they advertise as pet friendly , but were anything but .	female
i thought i was going to die without my caffeine fix .	female
f this place and the dirty vibe within and without .	female
my boyfriend got the french toast , said it was okay but cold .	female
sort of looks like he just got out of prison .	female
tech was on vacation , so could n't get someone out until august .	female
the curry sauce was thin , runny , and poorly seasoned .	female
potato salad was also old tasting and could not eat .	female
the enterprise rental was smelly and their representative was rude .	female
i go in , and was told to stop taking the med .	female
pay for your drink and run out of the door like now !	female
i think we got the worst part of the duck as well .	female
her main reason was that she was tired and wanted to go home .	female
when i went there the other day the service was really terrible .	female
our waiter was rude and the food was sub par for the price .	female
so at this point i did n't even want to be there .	female
i probably would have chosen a different place to have lunch .	female
i will not be back because of the horrible service .	female
if you are not all ordering steak , skip it !	female
i went in to pick up my shoes and he could not find them .	female
the food was so burned we could not eat it .	female
out table stove was not hot enough so we ended up with boiled meat .	female
we were not charged for it , but i still was n't thrilled .	female
it was dirty , loud , obnoxious and just plain gross .	female
when we walked through the halls , it smelled so much like smoke .	female
on top of that the hygienist was chewing gum the entire appointment .	female
i could n't even eat my food it was really nasty .	female
the first night i came , i was by myself , and starving .	female
i am not sure what they were , but not what i was expecting .	female
storage max has an extremely rude staff , from our experience .	female
bring your own towel , they do n't provide you with anything .	female
i am not a regular when it comes to dry cleaning .	female
did not have kale for one of their juice drinks .	female
i had the runner take it back and continued to wait for my plate .	female
but once i went to pay , they did n't want to honor it .	female
my chicken enchiladas had the chicken on top of the rolled tortilla with cheese .	female
every time i find out a concert is here , i am partially disappointed .	female
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day .	female
it was n't great , but it was n't horrible .	female
i did n't find anything i found to be spectacular here .	female
the man behind the counter seemed mildly annoyed taking our order .	female
it was really gross and reminded me of chewing on fat .	female
the beef tips over rice had no sauce so it was dry .	female
a diet coke turned into an ice tea and she figured the bill wrong .	female
never again will i ever go back to this place .	female
if only i could give minus stars , then would it be accurate .	female
i would n't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend .	female
this was the worst visit to an urgent care i have ever been to .	female
used the drive thru , there was hardly a wait .	female
we walked in and were hit with the dated decor and peeling wallpaper .	female
the service was friendly and relatively fast but the food was mediocre .	female
our mistake was not going down there to see their stock !	female
the chicken had obviously been cooked earlier in the day & left to sit .	female
no flavor , soggy french fries , over sauces wings .	female
i should have read these reviews prior to hiring adobe !	female
as i started to leave , i felt taken advantage of .	female
the people who work in the service department are incredibly rude .	female
service was really great but unfortunately the food was mediocre .	female
not to mention he did not write down what we ordered the first time .	female
my friend got the same dish and was disappointed as well .	female
the cashier do n't understand you and the order was messed up .	female
was n't really an upgrade , just a slightly larger room .	female
as i got to my house , he said he would charge me double .	female
i do n't understand why people think this place is so amazing ?	female
it was crazy , and i wish they would fix this .	female
he is an embarrassment to all of us who work in guest services .	female
rolled tacos were decent , ca n't really mess that up .	female
i ordered them last night for the first time and it was pretty bad .	female
ive only gone in for lunch but everything ive had has been stellar .	female
horrible customer service for being the only ones left in the dining area .	female
first , i was placed in a dirty room on the second floor .	female
i love this company , but this location is awful .	female
would it really hurt the restaurant to give me more sour cream ?	female
she never gave advice as to why or what else can be done .	female
but i would have sent it back if i were on my own .	female
i threw all the food out and will never return .	female
i spoke with the hostess and informed her of the poor service .	female
he sits out there on the curb holding a hose .	female
all in all , i would n't make a special trip .	female
moo goo gai pan was salty and all of the vegetables overcooked .	female
yoga clothing , books , cds , candles and jewelry .	female
they will up charge you for any left over food .	female
went here on a recommendation and because they have home made gluten free pasta .	female
the room is spacious and had all of the amenities that you need .	female
been here for two hours and was skipped by two patients after me .	female
do n't recommend going here and i will never go back again !	female
the only good thing about this place is their hours .	female
no wonder this place is putting out deals to attract more people .	female
if i could give this place no stars i would .	female
one bad visit and then we waited a few months to try again .	female
if i could i would give this place zero stars .	female
i have never been treated that way with any owner of a business .	female
the casino downstairs is okay , but not that great .	female
you would have a better stay in a box outside on a corner .	female
they did n't bother to lift up the car seat to vacuum under it .	female
this ended up not being true , they did have a buffet .	female
if i could give this place negative stars i would .	female
this hotel smells ... ew i would never stay here .	female
the employees were nice , but the store seemed so empty !	female
the hostess and our waitress were not friendly at all .	female
the atmosphere was nice but most everything else was mediocre including the coffee .	female
the teachers are decent , but the prices are ridiculous .	female
i looked for a name tag but she was n't wearing one .	female
so i approached another person and he said oh let me get somebody .	female
for half the price , i would take it but not the full price .	female
my last three visits the front desk has been rude .	female
if i would have to do it again i would go to another location .	female
the soup was ok but nothing to write home about .	female
either way , i am not going back to find out .	female
sadly , this is not the first time this has happened .	female
this time however , the good was not good and the service sucked .	female
there are not many vegetarian options , which is normally ok for me .	female
they had salt and pepper squid , which again was okay .	female
he said the guests were so stupid left the whole salmon on the table .	female
they were rude to a family member who called also .	female
this hotel is old , smelly and just overall filthy .	female
this club needs to find a new staff to handle the tickets .	female
my two sons and daughter in law are all still sick .	female
from the hostesses to the waitress , everything was just wrong .	female
my sandwich was dripping with sauce and had everything on it !	female
i could go on , but you get the point .	female
i have never been treated so poorly in my life by a professional .	female
the chicken was flavorful but the salsa were definitely lacking .	female
to add insult to injury , the prices were absurd !	female
i just wanted to let you all know how horrible it was !	female
we think this is too long to ask us to wait .	female
obviously they could use some work on their staff though .	female
the sandwich was a whole lot more bread than pork though .	female
this hotel is horrible u get what you pay for .	female
worst dining experience ever i decided for first time to write a review .	female
in the last three months the service has been absolutely horrible !	female
because of her rudeness i left and did not do my hair there .	female
checking this place on my list as a do not eat here .	female
its been a couple days since we went there and i am still pissed .	female
the bread was a baguette that tasted like it came in a can .	female
unfortunately , i was unimpressed with the quality of my beverage .	female
my favorite thing about this airport is that you can not get lost .	female
i met several friends for a birthday here , saturday night .	female
if you go - maybe stick with the eggs max with chorizo .	female
apparently if you know someone there they will bump legitimate business for you !	female
my husband died here when he should not have died at all !	female
i tasted it , and thought it was tough and flavorless .	female
i am doing so because of how terrible my experience was .	female
although the guys were nice , my car was not clean .	female
staff is rude and they are out of lots of items .	female
she then tells me she is going to another register .	female
i know how absurd that sounds , because it was absurd .	female
the flavor was n't anything to write home about ... .	female
ben got chicken fried rice , and the pan fried shrimp .	female
the heated massage table saved me , even though it was kind of small .	female
it is literally just a decent place to sleep and shower .	female
worst customer service ever and i will never go back to support this establishment .	female
but ... our waitress was nowhere to be found , again !	female
some of the worst seating i have ever been in .	female
the food and drinks are bad , especially for vegas and the venetian .	female
and that they just forgot the sour cream and pepper .	female
so did things get better after i had the baby ?	female
on my latest visit i ordered a dish of crab stuffed shrimp .	female
we did only tell her once that we would like them .	female
the lettuce had been frozen and so it was wilted .	female
my husband had a burrito that no amount of salsa could help .	female
for what you pay this meal is definitely not worth it .	female
i would n't stay at this hotel , even for free .	female
do n't waste your money or your time at this place .	female
the waitress was nice but overall i would n't dine here again .	female
if i was able to do zero stars i would give it that .	female
i explained i only brought my debit and he just shrugged .	female
if you want to get ripped off on a date , come here .	female
there was absolutely no flavor , and my fish was severely overcooked .	female
the roasted potatoes were pleasant , a little salty for my personal tastes .	female
they ended up not having one of the advertised yelp eats entrees .	female
if i could give this place zero stars i would .	female
we could n't even lift the pizza with our hands to eat it .	female
i will never go back to this hole in the wall again !	female
guess some people do n't care about the real human shoppers .	female
wedge had wilted lettuce , tasteless tomato and the blue cheese had zero flavor .	female
it was a little bit awkward , just us and the sushi chefs .	female
if you do n't mind getting bit by bed bugs , then go ahead .	female
the manager just did n't seem to care about anything .	female
needless to say we left and will not be back .	female
should have stopped there but i was hungry and ticket read gluten free .	female
one up side : ridiculous amount of food for a really good price .	female
the chips and salsa that came with it were meh .	female
my husband and i went in here last week to look at beds .	female
always got the chicken , either in burrito or bowl .	female
she ate and we went to sleep the rest of that saturday .	female
i guess it was so bad i do n't remember it .	female
half of the orders placed had something wrong with them .	female
that is not what you want to hear first thing in the morning !	female
alas , i was covered and just in time for my appointment .	female
i looked around and the bartenders were waiting on other tables .	female
i called my insurance and they said that was completely not true .	female
the manager was n't in , i will be speaking to her today .	female
my order was n't complete , i had to ask for my toast .	female
this was very good !	female
she shows a sense of care with her patients .	female
overall pretty darn good .	female
i love this resort !	female
