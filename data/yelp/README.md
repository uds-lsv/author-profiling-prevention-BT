We only provide new dev and test sets for reproducing our result. The Train sets are not in this repository because of their big sizes, you can obtain them from the links below:

Yelp Sentiment: You can get it from the [CAE Github](https://github.com/shentianxiao/language-style-transfer/tree/master/data/yelp)

Yelp Gender: Follow instructions on the [Privacy-Aware Text Rewriting](https://github.com/xuqiongkai/PATR) repo or [here](https://github.com/dadelani/PATR). We are making use of the first 100,000 sentences for male and female gender as the train set.
