the property is dated .	0
this place is not very consistent .	0

not worth the trip .	0
the food here is pretty good but horrible service .	0
this place has really fallen off .	0
the staff is completely incompetent .	0

this place is not for me .	0
wow , what a bad experience .	0
my complaint is not about the food .	0
the place was dead .	0
the rooms were not that great .	0
it was a lot of money for average food .	0
that is why they get one star .	0
has n't in over a year .	0
i do n't know why i bother going here .	0
unfortunately i have to shop here regularly .	0
too bad the dining experience ruined the night .	0
you guys need an inventory control system .	0
nobody stopped for half an hour .	0
mccarran does n't seem that bad anymore .	0
talk about low standards .	0
very bad customer service .	0
meat with butter , could n't even test meat .	0
i avoid this place as much as i can .	0
poor experience all around .	0
soggy , and no sauce .	0
this is a little ridiculous .	0
what kind of crap is this ?	0
he could n't care less .	0
this store is missing the mark on many levels .	0
i did n't even care at that point .	0
bland is the best description .	0
the food was mediocre at best .	0
so , i left .	0
thanks , but no thanks .	0
do n't trust this place .	0
this place is the absolute worst .	0
all my experiences have thus far been satisfactory .	0
so i gave it a chance .	0
very disappointing meal there last weekend .	0
no calls , no emails .	0
very unnecessary and not good business practice .	0
concord has lost my business for good .	0
warm rather than hot , and drab .	0
i was neglected from this point forward .	0
until i tried other indian places , that is .	0
second , the layout on two holes is dangerous .	0
just drive down the street to dobson ranch .	0
the texture is all off .	0
the mashed potatoes were even worse .	0
i guess people in arizona like this garbage .	0
the food is bland .	0
sorry folks , but this place is terrible .	0
third , the vegetable selection is limited .	0
nothing seems particularly bad , just underwhelming .	0
a little steep for that neighborhood , i think .	0
this place is quite underwhelming .	0
she was bland and uninterested and slow as hell .	0
rack of ribs too fatty .	0
after this , it only gets worse .	0
drove into an empty parking lot .	0
poor service , noisy , but pretty good food .	0
wife and i stopped recently for lunch .	0
overall , a poor experience .	0
the meat essentially had no flavor at all .	0
i would not eat here again .	0
this ai n't no sesame inn .	0
not even the same caliber as chinatown in .	0
another thing was the rice , simply disgusting .	0
did n't eat it .	0
why does this place still exist ?	0
the pizza is never better than so-so .	0
the service tends to be a bit slow .	0
those days are long gone .	0
but if left a bad taste in my mouth .	0
a restaurant should n't be doing this .	0
what the hell happened ?	0
plus desert is to die for .	0
i do n't recommend .	0
this company is garbage .	0
took too long for as slow as business was .	0
chicken wings were well cooked , hot and crisp .	0
does anyone see a problem ?	0
fries soggy as hell serious ?	0
give me money gone .	0
how wrong i was .	0
this place is a waste of time .	0
service is totally crap .	0
you will not see anyone from the show .	0
not a good place .	0
why is it a problem for me ?	0
this is supposedly the biggest strip club in vegas .	0
full of rotten people .	0
what a let down .	0
the service was pathetic .	0
no wonder the place was empty .	0
the sheets were not even close to being clean .	0
i suggest another cab company .	0
took them almost an hour to wash my car .	0
no stains on the sheets or walls .	0
service was very poor .	0
the cashier was apologetic , but not by nature .	0
garlic knots seemed a little lacking on the flavor .	0
make sure you get everything in writing .	0
flour tortillas are not supposed to taste like that .	0
do n't believe the hype .	0
this place is really bad .	0
slow , rude , unhelpful , and completely clueless .	0
now i need to wait and reschedule again .	0
most of the girls are n't even that hot .	0
rent at your own risk .	0
my server did not want to be there .	0
this place has gone down hill .	0
this was my first visit .	0
the bar itself is n't very appealing .	0
well scratch the quick now .	0
as usual it was mediocre at best .	0
only a moderate selection of food .	0
this is the worst break masters in town .	0
save your money please do n't make my mistake .	0
thanks but no thanks .	0
maybe the food is just always cheap ?	0
are you effing kidding me ?	0
and there was nothing inside the terminal .	0
i hated this place .	0
use this as your last resort to go home .	0
the king triple delight was just so-so .	0
went back after the owner replied to my review .	0
bottom line the place is managed poorly .	0
i would n't call this place authentic korean bbq .	0
food was painfully bland .	0
so when i get my food everything is wrong .	0
they gave me the crunch wrap .	0
it looked like it was under cooked .	0
stick with cold subs .	0
that is not acceptable .	0
this place is straight garbage .	0
my chicken sandwich was dry and uninspired .	0
otherwise , do n't see myself coming back .	0
so i strongly advise against eating here .	0
the drinks here however are very cheap .	0
no where to chain up your bike .	0
so it could n't have been that bad .	0
the wings were stringy and had fishy smell .	0
pecan pancakes are doughy .	0
ill try them again sometime .	0
the neighborhood is questionable .	0
this place sucks compared to newer hotels .	0
too bad it ended there .	0
pho kim long has bad customer service .	0
the service here was terrible .	0
this is the worst fast food franchise in town .	0
first off , maintenance for the complex was terrible .	0
this place is over rated .	0
complete waste of time .	0
freaking nasty , overpriced , and incompetent staff .	0
would not recommend coming here .	0
server kim was awesome .	0
but kitchen has a lot of problems .	0
go to arrogant butcher .	0
tops liquor , this guy is losing you business .	0
i will not stay there again .	0
the five underneath it were thin and dry .	0
my experience here has been consistently bad .	0
a very negative place with negative energy .	0
even the cook gave me an attitude .	0
i will not return to this place .	0
the place was not busy at all .	0
little respect for patrons .	0
the waitress did not appear friendly at all .	0
i will never visit this place again .	0
this place continues to go downhill .	0
at best , this place is a drinking hole .	0
i would n't eat there .	0
prices are too high .	0
i do not recommend .	0
multiple things went wrong .	0
this place is in absolute joke !	0
no big deal they forgot i guess .	0
they did not care though .	0
do not live here .	0
rib tips have no meat .	0
hot links , nasty .	0
i tried my bbq favorite in the beef brisket .	0
what a bad move on my part .	0
the wifi was spotty .	0
there are better options in the area .	0
this is a prime destination of american tourists .	0
the service is atrocious .	0
i ordered a mega bacon cheeseburger and fries .	0
service here was terrible .	0
all in all , a terrible meal .	0
the chicken was dry and bland .	0
that does no good .	0
my gf thought the cobb salad was ok .	0
no wifi offered either .	0
pei wei is just as awful for less .	0
the service was atrocious .	0
the list goes on .	0
old , ugly , worn out , and dirty .	0
just avoid this place .	0
this place is not worth the price .	0
this was bad , even for fast food .	0
the place was nearly empty when we arrived .	0
i wanted so much to like pei wei .	0
this review has nothing to do with the food .	0
really not that great .	0
however , the goods essentially stopped there .	0
all in all , not a great food experience .	0
there are simply better options around the city .	0
not gon na happen .	0
do not eat here .	0
the food is just ok .	0
what a waste of time and money .	0
this place is a very mediocre mexican restaurant .	0
not to mention the food .	0
i thought it was from a sloppy oil change .	0
the steaks were cheap and the kids were obnoxious .	0
i will not shop here again .	0
the caesar salad was watery and not seasoned properly .	0
turns out they do not .	0
very tired and in need of a makeover .	0
the place is a complete scam .	0
bars must be a bad business for making money .	0
the food was underwhelming at best .	0
one of the worst experiences in car buying .	0
came in sat down promptly and order right away .	0
another smoke filled hotel .	0
yeah , just not the room you want .	0
the food does not justify the price .	0
never coming back to this place .	0
the place was a mess .	0
only positive is the beer .	0
tube tvs are way out of date .	0
talk about false advertisement .	0
time warner cable is the worst !	0
this place makes me sick !	0
the sushi here is nothing to be excited about .	0
the service is also poor .	0
the worst experience ever .	0
treatments i received were met with marginal benefit .	0
i was pissed off .	0
first , this is not a resort .	0
the yellow tail was bland .	0
no return trip planned in the future .	0
they did not look good .	0
the salad was what i call a lazy salad .	0
the side of ziti was flavorless .	0
not worth the money spent .	0
bad idea to pick the golden gate hotel .	0
now the bad things .	0
really limited selection : most items seemed really similar .	0
if you are stupid .	0
this family is a disgrace to the art business .	0
but ambiance was not the low spot .	0
cheese on everything but the shit beer .	0
i left and will never go back .	0
maybe i caught them on a bad day .	0
actually , just stay away .	0
save your money , go elsewhere .	0
moreover , the service was lackluster .	0
cheese enchilada tasted like dirt .	0
the place has a stink of a sewer .	0
the food on the other hand was bad .	0
this was a crappy experience .	0
very outdated , and super crowded .	0
do yourself a favor and skip this place .	0
it is nothing special .	0
the pizza was just ok .	0
lights off , doors locked .	0
the waiter was a heavy smoker and smelt bad .	0
taste wise , the pho was horrible .	0
additionally , the brisket smelled like it was spoiled .	0
even my american co-worker thought the food tasted horribly .	0
just like most auto body places .	0
these guys are dishonest people .	0
the hood will not line up .	0
call back and wait an hour with no response .	0
not even an email address from their web page .	0
this is n't a resort .	0
if i could rate them negative stars i would .	0
stay far away from this place .	0
very average food you can get almost anywhere .	0
at this point the issue was closed .	0
not worth your time or money .	0
the worst part ... extra , extra , extra .	0
will not recommend to anyone .	0
the food is below average at best .	0
charges for room is misleading .	0
food was bland , and not really filling .	0
overall not a bad experience .	0
a mess from top to bottom .	0
this is no exaggeration .	0
the breakfast burrito was particularly boring .	0
avoid this place if you can .	0
it could barely pass as a marriott .	0
to the venues credit , it wasnt terrible looking .	0
is there a negative star option ?	0
they dont even have toro in stock that night .	0
it was utterly disgusting .	0
this place was way worse than what i expected .	0
this place is the worst .	0
